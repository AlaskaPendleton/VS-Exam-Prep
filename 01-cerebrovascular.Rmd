## Available Guidelines

[Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for
management of extracranial cerebrovascular
disease](https://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(21)00893-4/fulltext)
[@aburahmaSocietyVascularSurgery2022]

## Presentation and Diagnosis

1.  **What is the definition of crescendo TIAs?**

    Frequent repetitive neurological attacks without complete resolution
    of the deficit between the episodes, usually over a 24 hour period. The result of which is the same neurological deficit. If the patient exhibits    progressive deterioration in neurological function between TIA episodes this is classified as a stroke in evolution not a crescendo TIA. (this will need referenced if you can) 

2.  **Who needs to be screened for carotid disease?**

    Not everyone should be screened for carotid disease, however, as only 15% of patients who have a stroke experience a warning TIA prior to their event, there is merit in screening high risk patients. The purpose of carotid
    bifurcation imaging is to detect "stroke-prone" carotid bifurcation
    plaque and identify a high-risk patient likely to benefit from
    therapy designed to reduce stroke risk.

    Traditionally, the clinical sign associated with carotid stenosis is the prescence of a neck bruit on auscultation.
     Focal ipsilateral carotid bruits in symptomatic patients has a sensitivity of 63% and a
    specificity of 61% for high-grade carotid stenosis (range, 70%-99%). As these figures suggest the absence of carotid bruit does not absolutely exclude the presence of a significant carotid bifurcation lesion, therefore additional criteria are used to determine which patients would benefit from screening:

    -   Evidence of clinically significant peripheral vascular disease
        regardless of age

    -   Patients aged >65 years with a history of one or more of the
        following atherosclerotic risk factors:

        -   CAD

        -   Smoking

        -   Hypercholesterolemia

    -   In general, the more risk factors present, the higher the yield
        of screening for the patient.
        
    -   The benefit of prophylactic treatment of high grade stenosis is
        estimated at a 1-2% stroke reduction risk per year.
        [@naylorWhyManagementAsymptomatic2015]

    -   Keep in mind that intervention (CEA/CAS) has only demonstrated a
        benefit in asymptomatic patient with life expectancy greater
        than 3 years. [@bulbuliaAsymptomaticCarotidSurgery2017;
        @halliday10yearStrokePrevention2010;
        @rosenfieldRandomizedTrialStent2016]

3.  **Ultrasound Imaging**
    - US is considered the best, least invasive, and cost effective method for detecting carotid stenosis on screening. 

    -   50-69% stenosis of ICA - US has a low sensitivity for 50-69% stenosis. A
        negative ultrasound in symptomatic patients necessitates
        additional imaging. Typically on scanning if 50-69% ICA stenosis is present:

        -   PSV 125-229 cm/sec
        -   EDV 40-100
        -   Internal/Common Carotid PSV Ratio 2-4

    -   70-99% stenosis of ICA- Typically on scanning:

        -   PSV >/= 230 cm/sec

        -   EDV >100 (EDV > 140 cm/sec most sensitive for stenosis >80%)

        -   Internal/Common Carotid PSV Ratio > 4

    -   Velocity-based estimation of carotid artery stenosis may need to
        be adjusted in certain circumstances:

        -   Higher velocities in women than in men.

        -   Higher velocities in the presence of contralateral carotid
            artery occlusion.

    -   High carotid bifurcation, severe arterial tortuosity, extensive
        vascular calcification, and obesity may also reduce the accuracy
        of US imaging.

4.  **Other Imaging Modalities**

    -   CTA

        -   Pro - fast, sub-millimeter spatial resolution, visualize
            surrounding structures.

        -   Con - cost, contrast exposure.

    -   MRA

        -   Pro - no contrast administered; can analyze plaque morphology.

        -   Con - Does not visualize calcium in plaque; overestimates
            the degree of stenosis (False positive for 50-69% to be read
            as >70%).

    -   Catheter-based digital subtraction imaging (DSA)

        -   Still considered by many the gold-standard imaging modality.

        -   Reserved for individuals with conflicting less-invasive
            imaging or those considered for CAS.

        -   Con - cost, contrast, and risk of stroke.

## Management

### **Optimal medical therapy**

First line management for asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis is medical optimisation of risk factors. 

**Hypertension**

-   Blood pressure reduction, with a target of \<140/90 mmHg through lifestyle
    interventions and anti-hypertensive treatment is recommended in
    individuals who have hypertension with asymptomatic carotid
    atherosclerosis or those with TIA or stroke after the hyper-acute
    period.

-   Each 10-mm Hg reduction in blood pressure among hypertensive
    patients decreases the risk of stroke by 33%. (can we reference this?) 

**Diabetes**

-   In diabetic patients glycaemic control to nearly normoglycemic levels (target hemoglobin
    A1C \<7%) is recommended to reduce
    microvascular complications and, with a smaller evidence base,
    macrovascular complications other than stroke. (ref) 

**Hypercholesterolaemia**

-   Risk of stroke decreased by >15% for every 10% reduction in serum
    LDL in patients with known coronary or other atherosclerosis. (Ref) 

-   Statin agents are recommended targetting LDL of 100 mg/dL, for those
    with coronary heart disease or symptomatic atherosclerotic disease,
    and LDL of 70 mg/dL for very high-risk persons with multiple risk
    factors.

-   High dose statin therapy in patients with TIA/stroke reduce future
    rates of stroke or cardiovascular events but not overall mortality
    at 5 years. [@karamHighDoseAtorvastatinStroke2008]

**Smoking Cessation** - Encouraging smoking cessation is paramount for these patients. Physician counseling is an important and effective
intervention that reduces smoking in patients by 10% to 20%. (REF) 

**Antithrombotic therapy** - Aspirin is the only
antiplatelet agent that has demonstrated improved benefit in
asymptomatic patients with carotid atherosclerosis. (REF) 

### **Carotid endarterectomy**

**Indications for Surgical Intervention**

-   Recommendations on when to operate after a TIA/stroke. 

    -   Acute stroke with a fixed neurologic deficit of >6h duration -
        When the patient is medically stable, intervention in 14 days or less after stroke is preferable.
        [@rothwellEndarterectomySymptomaticCarotid2004;
        @meershoekTimingCarotidIntervention2018]

    -   Consider urgent intervention in a medically stable patient with
        mild-moderate neurologic deficit, if there is a significant area
        of ischemic penumbra at risk for progression on imaging that is contributing to the patient's presentation.

    -   Stroke in evolution (fluctuating / evolving neurological deficit) or
        crescendo TIA (repetitive transient ischemia with improvement
        between events) - If the patient's neurological status is not stabilized by medical
        intervention then an urgent CEA should be considered. 

    -   In this clinical context CEA is preferred to CAS based on an increased embolic potential
        of carotid lesions.
        [@rantnerEarlyEndarterectomyCarries2017]

    -   Management of acute stroke [@powers2018GuidelinesEarly2018]

        -   \<4.5hrs from onset of symptoms - medical thrombolysis with tPA unless
            contraindicated.

            -   Patient age >80 and diabetes are contraindications to tPA administration after
                3hrs.

            -   Other contraindications include - hypertension, intracranial
                hemorrhage, recent stroke or cranial trauma, spine/brain
                surgery within 3 months, GI bleed within 21 days. 

        -   \<6hr from onset of symptoms - catheter directed therapy

-   What is the only emergent indication for CEA?

    -   Crescendo TIAs or a stroke in evolution with a surgically
        correctable lesion identified on imaging.

**CEA Intraoperative Techniques**

-   General concepts

    -   Patch angioplasty or eversion endarterectomy are recommended
        over primary arterial closure to reduce early and late
        complications of CEA (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A). (REF) 

-   Neuromonitoring/Shunting options during a carotid endarterectomy

    -   Procedure performed under local/regional anesthesia with direct neurological monitoring - the benefit being that the patient is
        awake and moving to command throughout the case. Improved
        neuromonitoring, however, has not been shown to reduce MI (myocardial infarction?) rate with CEA. (REF) 

    -   Determining shunt use using stump pressure- Clamp the inflow and place a butterfly attached to
        a-line tubing into the internal carotid atery. If the stump pressure is >
        40 mmHg the surgeon can chose to proceed without shunt placement, if \< 40mmHg then a shunt should be placed prior to proceeding. (REF) 

    -   EEG Neuromonitoring - EEG tech places neuromonitoring, monitored
        by the technician and neurologist remotely intraoperatively. Generally the surgeon should clamp the ICA
        for 3 minutes before proceeding, if the patient develops neurological deficit/EEG abnormalities then unclamp, await
        normalization of EEG, then proceed. 

    -   Non-selective shunting - the surgeon uses a shunt for all CEAs as standard practice, this is often done for all CEAs performed under general  anaesthesia. 

-   Techniques to reach high internal carotid lesions?

    -   A good knowledge of the available imaging while preparing for the procedure is essential when considering the level of the carotid bifurcation.  

    -   Nasotracheal intubation will allow for jaw closure and neck extension to facilitate exposure of
        higher lesions.

    -   Division of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle can be performed to improve exposure of a high bifurcation.
        Care should be taken to identify and preserve the glossopharyngeal nerve. 
        
    -   Styloidectomy.  

    -   ENT surgeon assisted mandible subluxation with assistance if previous
        techniques fail.
        

-   What is the best technique for a patient with an anatomically kinked internal
    carotid artery?

    -   Eversion carotid endarterectomy (only indication for selection for this technique 
        over patch endarterectomy), transection allows for reduction of redundancy
         at re-anastamosis. 

    -   Otherwise, no advantage has been shown between eversion or
        patch, both can be shunted.

-   Nerve Injuries -- where you would encounter these and, if injured, what
    deficit would be seen?

    -   Hypoglossal: Most commonly injured. 
        Usually passes above the bifurcation of the carotid artery.
        If injured the tongue will deviate toward the side of injury on protrusion.

    -   Glossopharyngeal: Commonly injured during high dissections. 
        Found under the posterior digastric muscle. 
        Injury can be devastating for patients resulting in difficulty
        swallowing and high aspiration risk.

    -   Vagus: Usually found adjacent and lateral to the common carotid. Injury can occur with
        carotid clamping. Patients develop hoarseness due to innervation of the laryngeal muscles 
        from the recurrent laryngeal nerve which is a branch of the vagus. 

    -   Marginal Mandibular: Branch of the facial nerve. Runs inferiorly to the angle of the mandible.
        Commonly a retraction injury during high dissections leading to the corner of the ipsilateral lip
        drooping, can be confused with a significant neurological deficit following the
        case. 

**Postoperative Complications**

-   What to do if the patient develops neuro deficits following carotid endarterectomy:
    Two main concerns- an intimal flap causing thrombosis or an embolic event resulting in a stroke.
    Perform a thorough neurological exam to confirm in operated corotid territory.

    -   If in OR -- perform duplex, if normal open wound and perform a
        cerebral angiogram.

    -   If in Recovery or on the floor -- many would consider CTA first line
        vs duplex to look for thrombosis.

-   Risk factors and how to manage hyperperfusion syndrome?

    -   Defined as an ipsilateral headache, hypertension, seizures, and
        focal neurological deficits likely in distribution of the carotid.
        Can present 2-3 days post surgery.

    -   Patients with uncontrolled hypertension are at risk for
        hyperperfusion syndrome, clinical practice guidelines from SVS
        recommend strict BP control following CEA, with target pressure
        being less than 140/80mmHg. 

-   High risk groups

    -   ESRD patients have higher rates of perioperative stroke, but
        also have higher rates of stroke if not revascularized.
        [@klarinPerioperativeLongtermImpact2016]

**Long term complications and follow up**

-   Recommend f/u US duplex of bilateral carotids at \</=30 days. 
    >/= 50% stenosis further imaging is indicated.

-   Contralateral stenosis:

    -   The risk of progression for moderate stenosis at the initial
        surveillance to severe stenosis in the contralateral artery
        can be as high as 5 times. 

    -   Requires post-operative surveillance.

### Carotid Artery Stenting

-   In patients aged >70 the risk of intra- or post procedure stroke was the
    highest, if undergoing CAS, presumably due to calcified disease in the arch.

    -   Lesion-specific characteristics are thought to increase the risk
        of cerebral vascular events after CAS and include a "soft"
        lipid-rich plaque identified on noninvasive imaging, extensive
        (15 mm or more) disease, a pre-occlusive lesion, and
        circumferential heavy calcification.

    -   This risk can be reduced, but not eliminated, by using flow-reversal
        embolic protection rather than distal filter protection.

-   Limited data is available on CAS in asymptomatic patients - currently is not
    supported by guidelines or considered reimbursable. 

-   Consider CAS in symptomatic patients with >50% stenosis who are poor
    candidates for CEA due to severe uncorrectable medical comorbidities
    and/or anatomic considerations:

    -   Ipsilateral neck dissection or XRT - equivalent periprocedural
        stroke rate to CEA, but increased later stroke rate. CEA higher
        rates of cranial nerve damage (9%).
        [@giannopoulosRevascularizationRadiationinducedCarotid2018]

    -   Contralateral vocal cord paralysis.

    -   Lesions that extend proximally to the clavicle or distal to C2.

-   Transfemoral Approach vs Transcarotid approach

    -   ROADSTER Trial - single arm study with flow reversal for
        cerebral protection. Suggested lower rates of post-op stroke 
        in patients undergoing TCAR.

-   Post-CAS follow up - Dual-platelet therapy should be continued for 1
    month after the procedure, and aspirin should be continued
    indefinitely.

    -   In stent restenosis (>50%) - repeat angioplasty or stent have
        low incidence of periprocedural stroke but failed to improve
        long term stroke/death/MI or patency rates.
        [@chungPercutaneousInterventionCarotid2016a]

### Management of Uncommon Disease Presentations

-   Occluded Carotid: What is the management of an occluded carotid?

    -   Leave it alone.

-   What if an occluded carotid on imaging is still causing TIAs?

    -   External carotid endarterectomy and ligation of the internal carotid. 

    -   The addition of oral anticoagulation is likely to reduce the
        rate of recurrent stroke. 

-   What if the patient has severe vertebrobasilar insufficiency and
    carotid artery disease?

    -   Should undergo carotid revascularization first to improve flow. 
        Then reassess for vertebrobasilar insufficency. 
    -   Vertebrobasilar insufficiency characterized by dizziness,
        ataxia, nausea, vertigo and bilateral weakness.
        [@limanetoPathophysiologyDiagnosisVertebrobasilar2017]

-   What about tandem lesions in the carotid in a symptomatic patient,
    carotid bulb and carotid siphon lesion (high ICA)? How should you
    treat this?

    -   Treat carotid bulb first, likely to be the embolic source.

-   Carotid artery dissection

    -   Patients with carotid dissection should be initially treated
        with antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet agents or
        anticoagulation) (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence C).

    -   Indications for endovascular treatment of carotid artery
        dissection [@cohenSinglecenterExperienceEndovascular2012;
        @markusAntiplateletTherapyVs2019a;
        @phamEndovascularStentingExtracranial2011]

        -   Ongoing symptoms on best medical therapy

        -   Contraindication to antithrombotics

        -   Pseudoaneurysm

-   Simultaneous coronary and carotid disease

    -   Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis will benefit from CEA
        before or concomitant with CABG. The timing of the intervention
        depends on the clinical presentation and institutional
        experience (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B).

    -   Patients with severe bilateral asymptomatic carotid stenosis,
        including stenosis and contralateral occlusion, should be
        considered for CEA before or concomitant with CABG (GRADE 2,
        Level of Evidence B).

    -   Patients undergoing simultaneous CEA/CABG demonstrate highest
        mortality. [@naylorSystematicReviewOutcomes2003]

## Prospective Trials - MUST READS

1.  Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS)

    -   Compared medical management with CEA in asymptomatic patients
        with > 60% stenosis.

    -   5-year stroke and death rate was 5.1% vs 11%.

    -   In women, the benefit of CEA was not as certain as 5y stroke and
        death rates were 7.3% vs. 8.7%.

    -   This trial was conducted pre-statin and clopidogrel era.

2.  North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET)
    [@northamericansymptomaticcarotidendarterectomytrialcollaboratorsBeneficialEffectCarotid1991]

    -   Compared medical management vs CEA for symptomatic patients with
        moderate (50-69%) and severe stenosis (>70%)

    -   Only moderate impact for patients with moderate stenosis
        (50-69%)

    -   Symptomatic patients with >70 % stenosis benefited from CEA, at
        18 months 7% major stroke in surgical arm, and a 24% stroke rate
        in medical arm. 29% reduction in 5-year risk of stroke or death.

        -   Patients with severe >70% stenosis had such a dramatic
            effect the trial was stopped early for this subset and all
            referred for endarterectomy.

    -   No benefit is shown in symptomatic patients with \< 50% stenosis

    -   European studies have shown similar results

        -   ACST = ACAS

        -   ECST = NASCET.

3.  Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial
    (CREST).

    -   Compared CEA vs. CAS in both symptomatic and asymptomatic
        patients.

    -   Composite endpoint of 30-day stroke, MI, death equivalent
        between CEA and CAS.

    -   CAS had a significantly higher incidence of stroke and death
        than CEA and CEA higher incidence of MI.

        -   Follow up at 10 years demonstrated no difference in
            composite stroke/MI/death but increased rate of stroke/death
            in stented patients likely attributable to increased
            periprocedural stroke. [@brottLongTermResultsStenting2016b]

    -   Subanalyses identified that older patients (>70y) had better
        outcomes after CEA than CAS, the QOL impact of stroke was more
        significant than that of MI, and anatomic characteristics of
        carotid lesions (longer, sequential, remote) were predictive of
        increased stroke and death after CAS.

    -   Unfortunately, this study provides a benchmark to strive for,
        but no other large trials have achieved these results.

4.  ROADSTER

    -   Single arm feasibility trial of transcarotid carotid stenting.

    -   The results of the ROADSTER trial demonstrate that the use of
        the ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS is safe and effective at preventing
        stroke during CAS. The overall stroke rate of 1.4% is the lowest
        reported to date for any prospective, multicenter clinical trial
        of CAS.

5.  Trials to look out for in the next few years:

    -   CREST-2 - a multicenter, randomized controlled trial underway
        evaluating revascularization against modern intensive
        medical management.

    -   ACT-1 and ACST-2- the role of intervention in asymptomatic
        patients, designed to compare the early and long-term results of
        CEA vs CAS and best medical management.

    -   ROADSTER-2 - TCAR.
