Thoracic Outlet Syndrome = A constellation of signs and symptoms
relating to the compression of the neurovascular structures that occurs
as these structures travel between the thoracic aperture and the upper
limb.

Types: Neurogenic, Venous and Arterial 

-   vTOS -- 2-3%

-   aTOS -- 1%

-   nTOS --  >95% @humphries124ThoracicOutlet2019

## Anatomy

Understanding the anatomy of what is collectively referred to as the
thoracic outlet is the best way to thoroughly appreciate this topic.

Three spaces where the neurovascular structures are at risk of
compression:

1.  Interscalene Triangle 

2.  Costoclavicular Passage @garygwindAnatomicExposuresVascular2013

3.  Subcoracoid Space @garygwindAnatomicExposuresVascular2013

**Interscalene Triangle:**

Appreciating the attachments of the Anterior and Middle Scalene Muscles
on the first rib becomes important in the diagnosis of the various types
and also the ultimate surgical management of the compression.

**Anterior Scalene:**

Attachments: Anterior Tubercles of the four 'typical' cervical vertebrae
(3-6) AND the scalene tubercle on the upper surface of the first rib.

**Middle Scalene:**

Attachments: The posterior tubercles and intertubercular lamellae of all
the cervical vertebrae AND the Quadrangular area between the neck and
subclavian groove of the first rib. @mcminnLastAnatomyRegional2019

**The First Rib:** 

-   The broadest and flattest of the ribs and is an 'Atypical Rib'. 

-   The upper surface of the first rib has the scalene and quadrangular
    tubercles for attachments of the anterior and middle scalene muscles
    respectively. There are also three grooves for the Subclavian Vein,
    artery and the Lower Trunk of the Brachial Plexus. 

-   The Inferior Surface is smooth and inferior and medially has an
    attachment for the suprapleural membrane, Sibson's fascia AKA
    scalenus minimus, which is tethered to the C7 vertebrae. 

-   This is the passage of the subclavian vein largely as it emerges
    through the tight space created by the clavicle, the subclavius
    muscle and the costoclavicular ligament and also more posteriorly
    this can also compress the artery and nerves as the space can also
    be narrow in relation with the scapula and subscapularis. \[2\]

**Subclavius Muscle:**

-   Attached to the costochondral junction of the first rib and is
    inserted into the subclavian groove on the inferior surface of the
    clavicle. @mcminnLastAnatomyRegional2019

-   This space is best appreciated by intimate knowledge of three
    things:

    -   The Coracoid Process and its attachments

    -   The Pectoralis Minor Muscle

    -   The Clavipectoral Fascia

**The Coracoid Process:** 

-   Arising from the Scapula as a 'process', this broad-based bony
    landmark offers attachment to muscles and ligaments.

-   The relevant attachments being the pectoralis minor muscle occupying
    the medial border for about 2cm behind its tip. The tip itself
    having a medial and lateral facet for the short head of biceps and
    the coracobrachialis muscles respectively.

**Pectoralis Minor Muscle:**

Attached to the bone of the third, fourth and fifth ribs AND the medial
border of the coracoid process. 

**Clavipectoral Fascia:**

A sheet of fascial membrane that fills the space between the clavicle
and pectoralis minor splitting and encompassing the subclavius muscle.
Its superior portion is what can be thickened and become a tight band
referred to as the costocoracoid ligament. 

**Phrenic Nerve Anomaly:**

The Phrenic Nerve normally runs anterior to the Subclavian Vein. A rare
anomaly is the nerve compressing the vein anteriorly and in very rare
circumstances due to the timing of development can run through the vein
itself.

Anomalous anatomy can also cause TOS especially when patients have a
Cervical Rib and anomalous first ribs or a congenital band attaching to
the first rib.

-   Incidence of anomalous first ribs and cervical ribs is 0.76% and
    0.75% respectively. 

-   Incidence of bands are as high as 63% in the general population.
    @humphries124ThoracicOutlet2019

nTOS  

-   Scalene Triangle compression -- most common cause of brachial plexus
    and neurogenic TOS

-   Cervical Rib and Anomalous First Rib

aTOS

-   Cervical Rib and Anomalous First Rib

-   Scalene Triangle compression

vTOS

-   Costoclavicular Passage

-   Subcoracoid Space

## Diagnosis and Evaluation

### Patient History

-   Identify symptoms and thoroughly interrogate timing

-   Exclude history of trauma

-   Associated symptoms like headache, visual disturbance, neurology in
    the upper limb

-   Exclude Carpal Tunnel and Antecubital Tunnel Syndromes if symptoms
    are isolated to the arm or forearm or hand

-   Patients with vTOS may present acutely and have acute or subacute
    Upper Limb DVT

-   Patients with aTOS need to be investigated and assessed urgently
    given risk of ischemia. 

### Clinical Examination

Provocative maneuvers are largely used for nTOS. While these are
described and mentioned in most texts their utility largely is beyond
the scope of a vascular surgeon's assessment and diagnosis of nTOS.

**Adson Test**

-   Extended abducted and externally rotated arm -- palpate radial pulse

-   Rotate and laterally flex the neck to the ipsilateral side while
    inhaling deeply.

-   A positive test results in reduction or complete obliteration of
    radial pulse

**Roos Test / EAST test**

-   Patient seated and both arms abducted 90 degrees and externally
    rotated and elbows flexed at 90 degrees. 

-   Open and close hands for 3 minutes or until pain or paraesthesia
    sets in.

**Elveys Test**

-   Abduct both arms to 90 degrees with elbows extended and dorsiflex
    both wrists.

-   If pain is elicited as wrists dorsiflexed then test is positive.

-   A further manoeuvre is then performed, laterally flex the head on
    each side, if pain is elicited on the contralateral side to which
    the head is flexed then test is positive.
    @humphries124ThoracicOutlet2019

### Non-invasive imaging or vascular lab studies

-   DBI

-   Arterial Duplex

-   Venous Duplex 

-   CT -- CTV commonly performed in acute upper limb DVT and suspicion
    of vTOS

-   CTA for the evaluation of aTOS and excluding other causes of
    embolisation

-   MRI -- for further evaluation of the anatomy and related
    neurovascular compression

-   Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Studies for nTOS

**Paget Schroetter Syndrome**

-   First defined by Hughes in 1949 in reference to Sir James Paget who
    in a hundred years earlier defined acute arm swelling and pain as
    possibly related to vasospasm and then von Schroetter who in 1884
    attributed to the presentation to subclavian and axillary vein
    thrombosis. @humphries123ThoracicOutlet2019

-   Now vTOS and Paget Schroetter Syndrome are used synonymously.

-   Paget Schroetter Syndrome accounts for 10-20% of all upper extremity
    deep vein thrombosis. @sekharYearbookVascularEndovascular2018

## vTOS

### Presentation

-   Incidence: 2/100,000 persons

-   Age: 18 years to 30 years
    @illigComprehensiveReviewPagetSchroetter2010

-   M>F

    -   Upper Limb edema, pain and cyanosis. Edema affects the shoulder,
        arm and hand and characteristically non pitting.

    -   Collateral vein dilatation over the shoulder, neck and anterior
        chest wall to accommodate for the increased venous hypertension.
        @humphries123ThoracicOutlet2019

    -   Pain on exertion of the upper limb described as stabbing, aching
        or tightness.

    -   The reported incidence of PE following Upper Limb DVT is \<12%.
        @humphries123ThoracicOutlet2019

### History

-   A differential diagnosis for Upper Limb DVT

    -   vTOS

    -   Congenital Phrenic Nerve anomaly

    -   History of Fracture, Clavicular Fracture and malunion

    -   Repetitive arm provocative manoeuvres, check occupation and
        history of body-building

        -   Pectoralis Minor Hypertrophy.

-   Exclude Pulmonary Embolism 

-   Exclude Venous Gangrene and Phlegmasia of the upper limb

### Goals of therapy for vTOS

Limited evidence due to lack of RCT's. Majority of evidence based on
retrospective studies. 

-   Prevent immediate risk 

-   Return patient to unrestricted use of the affected extremity

-   Prevent recurrence of thrombosis without the need of long-term
    anticoagulation

-   Prevent long term Post Phlebitic Limb Syndrome

### Initial management strategy

-   Initial Management

-   As per ACCP Guidelines: Initial management is anticoagulation
    regardless of etiology. @kearonAntithromboticTherapyVTE2016

    -   The limitations of anticoagulation alone are that the slow
        recanalization of the thrombus may lead to eventual valvular
        damage and intravenous scarring.
        @sekharYearbookVascularEndovascular2018

    -   Thrombolysis has been considered superior to anticoagulation
        alone in minimizing valvular damage due to residual clot.
        @urschelSurgeryRemainsMost2008

    -   Systemic Lysis -- non favoured due to risk of intracranial
        haemorrhage. @grunwaldCatheterDirectedThrombolysisTreatment2004

    -   Catheter Directed Lysis (CDT) -- carries a lower risk of
        intracranial haemorrhage.

-   Optimal timing of CDT

    -   Within 14 days of onset of thrombosis. Excellent results have
        been reported following CDT if initiated before 14 days.
        @wilsonFibrinolyticTherapyIdiopathic1990

-   Surgical indications for vTOS

    -   After initial management patients are generally divided into two
        groups, unsuccessful or successful thrombolysis.

    -   Persistent stenosis or signs of extrinsic compression, on
        venography, has generally been perceived as a significant risk
        of recurrent thrombosis.

    -   Surgery for vTOS remains to be mainly Rib Resection and
        decompression of the subclavian vein with or without venolysis
        and patch plasty either surgical or endovenous.

### Controversy around vTOS

-   There is a lack of consensus around the necessity of surgical rib
    resection, the timing and the requirement for vein patch plasty.

-   Options post recanalization:

    -   Deferring surgical decompression for 1-3 months after
        thrombolysis to allow for healing of the venous endothelium and
        resolution of the acute inflammatory process.
        @humphries123ThoracicOutlet2019

    -   Decompression during the same admission, as the thrombolysis,
        with the main benefit being to reduce the risk of re-occlusion.
        @humphries123ThoracicOutlet2019

### Landmark papers regarding vTOS and what are the take home messages

1.  Lugo J et al -- Acute Paget Schroetter syndrome: does the first rib
    routinely need to be removed after thrombolysis? Annals of Vascular
    Surgery 2015 @lugoAcutePagetSchroetter2015

    1.  Systematic literature review analysis. Patients divided into
        three groups

        1.  First Rib resection (FRR) -- n=448

        2.  First Rib resection and endovenous venoplasty (FRR and
            PLASTY) n=68

        3.  No further intervention after Thrombolysis n=168

    2.  Symptom relief after initial follow up more likely in FRR (95%)
        and FRR and PLASTY (93%) compared to no rib removed (54%) --
        p\<0.0001

    3.  Results showed superior patency with FRR and PLASTY and FRR
        compared to anticoagulation alone. 

    4.  Conclusion was that patients are more likely to experience
        greater long-term results with FRR compared to no FRR. 

2.  Sajid MS et al -- Upper limb vein thrombosis: a literature review to
    streamline the protocol for management. Acta Haematology 2007
    @sajidUpperLimbDeep2007

    1.  a comprehensive review identifying the key papers on this topic
        and allows for a clear view of the best management strategy. 

## aTOS

### Presentation

-   Most common: Hand ischemia due to arterial compression or
    microembolization

-   Exertional pain 

-   Unilateral Raynaud's Phenomena

-   Subclavian artery aneurysm and pulsatile supraclavicular mass

-   Rarely retrograde embolisation and neurological symptoms 

-   Clinical Examination

    -   Audible Bruit / Palpable thrill over the supraclavicular fossa

    -   Pulsatile mass

    -   Distal ischemic lesions in the distal hand -- Splinter
        haemorrhages

    -   Positive Adson Test

### Important differentials for aTOS

-   Trauma

-   Primary and Secondary Raynaud's Phenomena

-   Small Vessel Vasculitis

-   Connective Tissue Disorders

-   Thromboangiitis Obliterans

-   Arterial Embolisation -- Aortic or Central Source

-   Radiation Arteritis

-   Atherosclerotic / Dissection causes

### Most common causes of aTOS - The different Anatomical Abnormalities causing aTOS (incidence %)

-   Cervical Rib (60%)

-   Anomalous First Rib (18%)

-   Fibrocartilaginous band (15%)

-   Clavicular Fracture (6%)

-   Enlarged C7 transverse process (1%) @boll122ThoracicOutlet2019

### Scher Staging of aTOS

-   Stage 0: Asymptomatic

-   Stage 1: Stenosis of Subclavian Artery with minor post stenotic
    dilatation with no intimal disruption

-   Stage 2: Subclavian artery aneurysm with intimal damage and mural
    thrombus

-   Stage 3: Distal embolisation from subclavian artery disease

### Management considerations with aTOS

-   Symptomatic patients are generally indicated for treatment. Unlike
    asymptomatic patients in whom it may be appropriate to manage
    conservatively. @boll122ThoracicOutlet2019

-   Supraclavicular rib resection is the most suitable for adequate
    arterial reconstruction. Transaxillary has been argued to offer more
    complete rib resection however arterial repair is not possible in
    this approach.

-   Subclavian artery repair is necessary in Scher Stages 2 and 3 and in
    some cases 1. Arterial repair with conduit either GSV, Femoral Vein
    or prosthetic have been described. Ringed PTFE offers good patency
    and resistance to kinking in this functional anatomical location. 

## nTOS

### Demographics

Neurogenic TOS is largely a clinical diagnosis with symptoms and signs
pertaining to nerve compression most commonly the lower trunk of the
brachial plexus. 

-   F>M -- 70% Female

-   Ages 20-40

-   Occupational Exposure

-   Trauma history

### Presentation of nTOS

-   Symptoms

    -   Pain and Paraesthesia

    -   Numbness

    -   Neck pain

    -   Headaches

    -   Weakness

    -   Swelling

-   Positional Effects

    -   Reproducible exacerbation of symptoms

    -   Lying supine with arms overhead

    -   Overhead activities -occupational or recreational

-   Weakness and Muscle Atrophy

    -   Hypothenar atrophy

    -   Dropoff in athletic performance

    -   Inability to carry out activities of daily living 

### The role of the Vascular Surgeon with nTOS

Often these patients have already seen multiple specialists and
physiotherapists.

-   Exclude other causes

-   Confirm diagnosis -- Neurophysiologic Tests (EMG and NCS)

-   Seek alternate opinion

-   Trial of Physiotherapy and non-operative management

-   Be selective in patients who may require surgery

Surgery with Rib resection often is accomplished with transaxillary or
supraclavicular approach, particularly if scalenectomy or cervical rib
resection is necessary.
