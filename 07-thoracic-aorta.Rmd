```

**What is an aortic dissection?**

It's when a tear occurs in the intima that results in separation of
layers of the intima and media and allows blood to flow through the
false lumen.

**How common are they and how serious are they?**

Acute dissections occur around 3/100000 - 2-3x more common than ruptured
aortic aneurysm. For Type A dissections, early mortality 1-2% per hour -
if untreated, 20% die within 6 hours, 50% within 24 hours, 70% first
week. 

Main cause of death in type A is aortic rupture into the pericardium,
acute aortic regurgitation, and coronary ostia compromise. While
patients with descending thoracic aortic dissections are more likely to
die from end organ compromise due to obstruction of visceral or
extremity vessels in the acute phase of the disease. 

**The time frame is also important.**

-   Hyperacute \<24 hours 

-   Acute  \< 2 weeks  

-   Subacute 2 weeks -- 3 months -> TEVAR

-   Chronic >3 months  -> Chronic aneurysmal degeneration/ partial false
    lumen thrombosis (highest risk) = operative treatment

**When we think about aortic dissections there are a few
classifications, how can we break it down?**

Historically, there are the Stanford and Debakey Criteria.

Anatomical Stanford

-    Type  A - involves the ascending aorta, 2/3 (most common)

-    Type  B - arises from distal to L subclavian, 1/3

Debakey

-   A

    -   1 - ascending + descending

    -   2 - ascending only

-   B - distal or at the LSCA.

    -   3a - Descending aorta above diaphragm

    -   3b - Descending aorta above and below diaphragm

**How about the new system proposed by Dr Lombardi, the SVS-STS
classification system?**

The new system published in 2020 keeps A and B and adds a number system
which divides the aorta into zones from 0 proximaly to 12 distally in
the mid SFA. [@lombardiSocietyVascularSurgery2020]

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/thoracic_dissection1.png"))

```

-   Type A is now JUST the ascending aorta to the innominate, also
    called Zone 0. 

-   Type B is now an entry tear in Zone 1 or greater and distally to
    whichever zone the dissection lands in.

**This anatomical** **classification is based on reading the CT angio.
What else could we see on a CT angio that we have to know about?**

So aside from the aortic dissection its self, you could see a bleb of
contrast sticking out. That could be an penetrating aortic ulcer. That
is an atherosclerotic lesion that penetrates the internal elastic lamina
of the aortic wall.

Another key finding can be an intramural hematoma which is a hyperdense
crescent shaped hemorrhage within the aortic wall. There is no
identifiable direct communication between the true and false lumen. IMH
are classified in the same way but with the abbreviation IMH p-d zones.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/thoracic_dissection2.png"))

```

**Whats the significance of these two in combination?**

There is a higher chance of aortic rupture if a penetrating aortic ulcer
is seen with intramural hematoma.

**When a patient presents with an aortic dissection how can we classify
them clinically?**

-   Uncomplicated 

    -   Stable hemodynamics 

    -   No evidence of malperfusion

    -   Pain controlled 

-   Complicated 

    -   End organ ischemia / malperfusjon

    -   Rupture or impending rupture

-   High risk 

    -   Uncontrollable pain / hypertension 

    -   Bloody pleural effusion

    -   Aortic diameter >40mm / False lumen diameter > 22mm

    -   Readmission

    -   Radiographic only malperfusion 

    -   Entry tear on the lesser curve

**What is the danger of a false lumen? How does it lead to symptoms and
malperfusion? Likewise which arteries commonly branch off the true
lumen?**

The false lumen can lead to end organ ischemia as the intimal flap can
cover the ostia of branching vessels. This can be a static or a dynamic
obstruction.

Likewise it also leads to weakening in the wall of the aorta which can
become a threatened rupture or rupture if the diameter of the false
lumen is larger than 22mm. 

The celiac trunk, SMA, right renal typicaly come of the true lumen. Left
renal comes off the false. 

Also the dissection most commonly goes down into the left common illiac
rather than the right. You might be able to detect down stream effects
of this on clinical exam with reduced left sided groin pulse.

**What kind of patients get aortic dissections?**

Hypertension (older patients) / cocaine or Meth (younger patients) 

Marfans, loeys-Dietz, Ehlers danlos Type 4, Turners, Arteritis, Bicuspid
aortic valve.

We also have a traumatic cause of aortic dissections. That being called
blunt thoracic aortic injury:

-   Grade 1: intima tear

-   Grade 2: IMH

-   Grade 3: Pseudo aneurysm

-   Grade 4: Aortic rupture.

**How do these patients present?**

Signs and symptoms -- Chest pain 90% tearing pain radiating between the
shoulder blades. 

Chest pain extending to the abdomen abdomen? Think mesenteric ischemia
or aortic tear

Type A - Stroke 5-10%, Syncope 15%, tamponade, carotid dissection,
paralysis. 

Others: MI -- Hypovolemic shock -- leg ischemia

**What is the workup?**

Physical Exam -- Asymmetric pulses / blood pressure differences /
Diastolic murmur,

Investigations - CXR, EKG, D-dimer + Troponin, CTA, ECHO for type A. 

The big distinction is to find out if this is a type A or type B because
the treatment strategy is completely different.

-   Type A need an emergent operation

-   Type B starts with medical management, follow up CT angio  +/- Trans
    esophageal echo in the OR. Reevaluate at 24 hours. 

**What are the details of Type A treatment?**

Operative treatment. 30% op mortality. Cardiothoracics take the lead on
this one. However vascular surgeons should be involved in the management
of type A as after the repair, a type A can become a functional type B.

Type B is in the realm of vascular surgery. What is the first management
step after we have diagnosed a type B dissection?

Invasive impulse therapy. That means redusing the force of transmitted
impulse down the aorta. Blood pressure goals of 100-120mmHg. Hr \<
60bpm. 

**How would you achieve that?** 

Start with a beta-blocker (esmolol or labetalol) first then a
vasodilator (nitroprusside). This is to stop the sympathetic surge after
vasodialation that could increase pressure and thus tearing forces
inside the aorta worsening the dissection. 

Initial CT, 72 hours, 3 months x 4, q6 months x2, q12 month. (Descending
thoracic aorta that dialates first.) 

**Why isnt open surgery indicated for type B dissections?**

Open surgery is not recommended due to the high mortality 30% if \< 48
hours. 18% if \> 49 hours. 

In the acute setting mortality can be up to 50% with a 20% paraplegia
risk. Its been described as sowing tissue paper.

**What is the management plan for a complicated Type B aortic
dissection?**

Start with invasive medical management and plan for TEVAR. The goal with
TEVAR being to direct the blood flow into the true lumen and seal the
entry tear.  If there was a dynamic obstruction (flap occludes branching
vessels.) Then TEVAR would reestablish the true lumen hence removing the
dynamic obstruction. Endovascular fenestration can also equalise the
pressure in the true and false lumen. [@lombardiSTABLEIIClinical2020]

For a static occlusion there could be a thrombus or stenosis in the
branched vessel so a stent might be indicated. 

**What are the major risks of TEVAR in the management of Type B aortic
dissections?**

Retrograde type A (reported 2% in literature however it can be around
20% in some experiences), 5% paraplegia, and stent induced new entry.

**Is there a role for TEVAR in uncomplicated type B dissections?**

The INSTEAD and INSTEAD XL trials looked at uncomplicated Type B
dissections. There was NO statistical difference at 2 years comparing
OMT vs TEVAR but at 5 years there was good aortic remodelling and better
long term survival in patients treated in the subacute stage. 

Timing for TEVAR is a difficult choice. In chronic dissections the
septum thickens leading to a potentially difficult TEVAR.  Anecdotally
TEVAR is best at 2w-3m.

## Aortopathies

**18 May 2020**: *Dr. Anna Ohlsson and Dr Sherene Shalhub; University of
Washington*

**What are the common genetic aortopathies?**

There are several well-known genetic disorders which account for genetic
aortopathies. The most well-known are Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz
Syndrome, and Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome,

There are less commonly known ones such as Familial Thoracic Aortic
Aneurysms and Dissections due to pathogenic variants smooth muscle cells
genes such as *ACTA2*. There are others in which the causative gene is
not known.

**Why are they such a big deal?**

These are cases in which the building blocks of the aortic wall are
defective. What  I mean by this, is that these patients have pathogenic
variants in the genes that affect cell signaling or smooth muscle cell
structure that lead to suboptimal composition of the aortic wall.  These
alterations ultimately lead to cystic medial necrosis in the aortic
wall.

As such they are at more risk for aortic aneurysms and dissections that
can lead to the premature death of the patient.

To put the frequency in perspective, Marfan syndrome occurs in 1:5000 of
the population while Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (also known as
VEDS) occur in 1:50000 of the population.

**Let's dive into them then -- what are the defining features of each
and the high yield information?**

The high yield information is being able to pair the genetic syndrome
and phenotype with its associated genetic mutation.  A useful exercise
following this broadcast is to list the disorders in a table and write
out their associated gene mutation, what protein defect or deficit
occurs, the typical phenotype, and the common vascular pathology
associated.

But before we dive in, I want you to keep in mind some of shared
features.  One is that the associated aneurysms and dissections tend to
occur at younger ages and dissect at lower blood pressures than what we
see with sporadic dissections (these are the dissections that are not
familial or associated with a syndrome)

One is that these are inherited in an autosomal dominant matter but
there can be variation in how the pathogenic variants are expressed
among affected people and even within families. The other thing to
remember, is that in roughly half of these cases, the affected patient
is the first in their family to have a given pathogenic mutation. The
flip side of this, is in half the cases, there is a family history of
aortic aneurysms, dissections, and sudden death.

**We will start with Marfan syndrome.**

[Marfan syndrome]{.ul} is caused by pathogenic variants in
the *FBN1* gene (also known as fibrillin-1 gene). These variants lead to
improper formation of the microfibrils that maintain elastin, a key
component of the arterial wall. 

These patients are prone to aneurysmal degeneration and dissections of
the aortic root but can also dissect the descending thoracic aorta. They
commonly have lens dislocations (ectopia lentis).  They have common
skeletal features such as

being tall, thin, with long arms and legs, scoliosis, pectus deformities
(carnitatum or exicavtum), and club feet. They can also have a history
of spontaneous pneumothoraces and mitral valve prolapse.

**How is Marfan syndrome similar or different from the other genetically
triggered aortopathies that you mentioned?**

[Loeys Dietz Syndrome]{.ul} is similar to Marfan syndrome in all the
features including the aortic root aneurysms. They don't seem to have
lens dislocation and they have other unique features such as bifid uvula
or cleft palate, and hypertelorism (which is an abnormally increased
distance between the eyes).  What is different about Loeys Dietz
Syndrome from Marfan syndrome is that they can have arterial aneurysms
of other arteries instead of the aorta, such as the SMA, axillary, or
other peripheral arteries.

[Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]{.ul} has some shared features to
Marfan Syndrome with both such as spontaneous pneumothoraces, but these
patients tend to be short and can have easy bruising. They also have
similar features to Loeys Dietz syndrome in terms of arterial aneurysms.
Common features of VEDS would be thin translucent skin where you can
easily see their veins, thin lips, thin bridge of the nose, large eyes,
easy bruising, acrogeria -- or an aged appearance of the hands

However, unlike Marfan and Loey Dietz, the majority of VEDS patients
tend to not have aortic root aneurysms. One thing to remember about VEDS
is that it is a *subtype* of Ehlers Danlos syndromes.  It's very
important to distinguish it from the other subtypes because most of the
other 12 Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are not associated with arterial
pathology. So people with vascular EDS are prone to arterial, uterine,
and intestinal rupture and their average lifespan is 48 due to these
highly morbid pathologies.  25% of patients with vEDS will have
experienced some clinical manifestation by age 20, and that number is
close to 90% by age 40.   

**I remember learning about classic Ehler's Danlos presenting with
hypermobile skin and joints.  Is this something you see with Vascular
EDS as well?**

Patient's with vEDS don't have the same hypermobile skin or joint laxity
as we classically think of with classic Ehler's Danlos.  In fact, some
vEDS patients report losing confidence in their physicians who ask them
about joint and skin hypermobility because it suggests to them that
their doctor doesn't know about their disease process.  These patients
often know more than most of the doctors they meet about their
condition, and it's a source of constant frustration for them.  It can
also be a problem if the severity of the disease is underestimated, as
we discussed they can present much younger than most patients with
highly morbid issues -- like arterial rupture.

**You mentioned arterial pathology in Loeys Dietz and VEDS. Can you tell
me more about that?**

In both types you can see subclavian, carotid, SMA, and iliac artery
aneurysms and dissections, as well as less frequently vertebral, SFA,
and popliteal aneurysms and dissections.

**How do you diagnose these genetically triggered aortopathies?**

There are clinical diagnostic criteria for each, but ultimately genetic
and laboratory testing is very important for the final diagnosis.

Ghent's criteria is used to clinically diagnose Marfan's syndrome. The
big ones are aortic root dilation, known family history of Marfan's or
not, the diagnosis of ectopia lentis which clinically is manifested as
iridonesis (lens shimmering). Additionally, genetic testing for
pathogenic FBN1 variants is also diagnostic.

To date, there are 5 types of Loeys-Dietz as of last check. These are
due to pathogenic variants in the TGF-B signaling pathway, such as
TGF-beta receptors and SMAD3 genes. 

Vascular EDS is caused by a mutation in the COL3A1 gene which encodes a
defective type of III procollagen.  The defect in the procollagen makes
it unable to properly fold into a triple helix that forms the normal
collagen structure.  This causes the defective procollagen to be
degraded intracellularly and as a result there is an overall deficit in
type III collagen which is an important component of arterial walls and
other structures.  The confirmatory test for VEDS is collagen testing
which can confirm the collagen III defect.

**How would you manage these patients?**

Medical optimization and surveillance is key to try to extend the time
as much as possible before they get a dissection and avoid it if at all
possible. 

We start with lifestyle modification.  Avoid "burst" exertions such as
sprinting and weight-lifting.  Anything that very strenuous.   That's
not to say that they shouldn't exercise.  Light exercise is encouraged,
but this would be activities like light jogging, swimming laps, or
biking. 

In order to minimize aortic shear stress, a resting heart rate of under
70 beats per minute and an exercising heart rate under 100 should be the
goal.  This can be accomplished with beta blockers.  Propranolol has
been shown to significantly decrease the rate of aortic growth in
Marfans patients with a baseline aortic root diameter under 4cm.  There
is research into the use of Losartan in murine models that suggests it
inhibits TGF-beta in the aortic wall, which is an important pathway that
contributes to the breakdown of the wall.  However, randomized
controlled studies have failed to show an increased benefit of Losartan
over beta blockers in Marfans patients.  ACE inhibitors are also being
tested and are shown to decrease the risk of type b aortic dissection
over 6 years.

In vascular EDS instead of propranolol, celiprolol has been studied by
the French and shown to reduce vascular rupture from 50 down to 20% in
vEDS, although the mechanism of this is not yet clear and does not
appear to be necessarily the same as decreasing shear stress as in
Marfan's syndrome.   In general taking care of these patients involves
trying to minimize complications from procedures and interventions.  For
instance, use ultrasound for any line that is necessary and avoid
arterial lines, intramuscular injections, or other invasive lines if
possible to minimize the chance of a complication.  Patients are advised
to wear medical bracelets notifying that they have vEDS.

We also discuss the importance of forming a care team based on their
needs. This usually includes a cardiologist, a cardiac surgeon, a
vascular surgeon, and a primary care physician.

**What about surgical treatment for those who need it?**

For patients with Marfan's, prophylactic surgery is recommended for
aortic root dilation \>5cm or thoracic aorta \>5.5cm.  Often times the
thoracic and abdominal aorta are involved.  Open and endovascular
surgery are options for these patients. Open procedures often include
open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repairs, open cardiac surgery for
arch replacement, or cervical debranching procedures.  Endovascular
procedures can include regular TEVARs or branched TEVARs which require
extensive aortic coverage.  Open surgery can be well tolerated and is
ideal in the sense that you can replace the entire aorta which avoids
the future complications from continued aneurysmal degeneration, loss of
proximal or distal seal zones, or device issues that can plague
endovascular methods.  However open surgery, of course caries higher
complication risk and morbidity up front and does share some
complications with endovascular treatments as well.  Sometimes these
patients will have hybrid procedures and often their care will require
multiple surgery teams including cardiac and vascular surgery.  An
important thing to be up front with all of these patients about is that
this is a long term relationship with their surgeon, as they often
require multiple staged procedures, things aren't fixed in one
procedure, and even after they have been surgically addressed there is a
lifetime of maintenance and surveillance.  Ultimately, the decision for
open vs. endovascular approaches will vary between patients based on
their specific anatomy and arterial issues, what their body can
tolerate, and ultimately what their goals of care
are.[@lumEndovascularProceduresPatients2012a] Some may require having
their entire aorta replaced, while others may only need ongoing medical
therapy and surveillance and it's important to set expectations early.

**What about VEDS, when surgery cannot be avoided?  How do you mitigate
the risk of complications?**

The tissue is very fragile.  So using instruments that are the least
traumatic is key -- like fogarty clamps for vessels.  Sutures often must
be pledgetted to reinforce them.  Leave no tension on anastomoses or
suture lines.  Always keep a backup plan in mind-- when arteries cannot
be repaired, can they safely be ligated or embolized?  Generally any
large bore access for endovascular treatment is avoided because access
site complications are high and can lead to devastating consequences. 
In situations of extremis, like a rupture, these patients' tissues have
been known to completely breakdown.  Try to avoid the worst case
scenario, but of course sometimes it's the only option left to get out
of the OR.  Be upfront with the patient about how complications may
arise, set expectations, and think about goals of care early.

**We discussed earlier that these aortopathies can have shared
phenotypic characteristics, some of which can be used in a clinical
diagnosis, but are all of these genetic aortopathies syndromic?**

Let's start by saying that all patients with Marfan syndrome and VEDS
can have the syndromic features we just talked about.  However, it's not
always the case and the absence of these feature does not exclude the
diagnosis.  In fact, we recently treated a middle-aged woman with an
aortic dissection who had Marfan Syndrome confirmed with genetic
testing.  She had been diagnosed prior to her dissection because her
daughter had undergone genetic testing.  However, on meeting her, I
would not have guessed she had Marfan Syndrome, had I not known.  She
was average height, obese, and had no other relevant physical findings
on exam or history. 

This ties into another genetic aortopathy that we have not discussed yet
which are the familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.  They
do not have any syndromic features. For example, patients with ACTA2
pathogenic variants that cause alpha actin mutations which again
contribute to degeneration of the arterial wall.  These patients tend to
present 10 years younger than sporadic thoracic aortic aneurysms,
generally in their late 50s compared to late 60s, and women seem to be
less often effected than men. 

**Dr. Shalhub, I know vascular genetics is one of your passions.  Is
there anything else you want people to remember from this broadcast?**

Don't forget the family.  Once you've made the diagnosis in one of them,
remember it is autosomal dominant, so it's important to make sure the
family understands and that they are set up with the appropriate care
team and monitoring.  They may not all develop the same medical issues,
however as we discussed, ongoing medical management and lifestyle
changes are the key.
