## Chronic Venous Insufficiency

### Terminology and Presentation

**What is chronic venous insufficiency and how common is it?**

So I thought the first question was going to be a nice, easy
uncontroversial one and you've landed with CVI. What you've hit upon is
one of the main problems with venous disease, which is terminology. So
if you type in chronic venous insufficiency into Google, you end up
with, this enormous range of descriptions and how its used in lots of
different ways, by lots of different people.

One of the problems is that this led to a lot of confusion among people
within the space let alone everywhere else. So really important
documents to guide people to is the VEIN-TERM consensus document
published in 2009.[@eklof2009] The lead author was Dr. Bo Eklof and this
was a document where a whole group of venous experts around the world
got together and said, okay, we need to be clear and define what all
these different terms mean.

And what are the terms that he found was chronic venous insufficiency.
And the official definition is it is a venous disease between C3 and C6
on the CAEP classification. We'll talk about that a bit later, I'm sure.
But between C3 and C6. In practice, it is used to describe the entire
spectrum of venous disease ranging from thread veins C1 all the way up
to venous ulceration. But technically it is C3 to C6. And I would urge
anybody who is learning about the terminology to look at the vein term
documents.

And silly little things like great saphenous vein and small saphenous
vein--I think UK is the only place where long saphenous is ever used and
the real problem was LSV in lots of other countries will be the lesser
saphenous vein, which is the small saphenous vein. So again, I'd urge
anyone to look at that document.

**How common is chronic venous insufficiency?**

Chronic venous disease is very common, with the weather getting a bit
nicer, people wearing shorts, you're spotting, venous disease all over
the place. The studies that have been done indicate that at least a
quarter, probably up to a third of people have C2 to C6 disease. So very
common problem, lots of people that need treatment.

**Now we would like to discuss the classification and scoring systems,
you mentioned CAEP, could you expand on that?**

So CEAP\--clinical, etiological (with an E because it's American),
anatomical, pathophysiological--classification system was introduced, I
think in the mid 1990s, by the American Venous Forum and American
colleagues. And it's a classification system.

So if you have a patient that comes into your clinic with a venous
problem, it's a system to allow you to describe that patient's current
situation in an objective, clear way. What it does not do is give you
any information about prognostication and it isn't useful for measuring
responses to treatment.

So it is purely a descriptive classification system. And the most
commonly used bit is the clinical bit, which is C1 one to C6. And again,
CAEP was just recently revised last year, a 25 year revision, which
again, I would urge trainees to have a look at, Dr. Fedor Lurie was the
lead author, and just some useful revisions of CEAP.[@lurie2020]

Now in response to the limitations of CAEP, the Venous Clinical Severity
Score (VCSS) was created. So this is a 10 item scoring system, each item
scores between zero and three. So you get a maximum score of 30. Now
this is designed to be responsive to treatment and complimentary to
CAEP.[@vasquez2010]

There are lots of other things that have been described, quality of life
tools or VDS, but I would say that those two are the most relevant and
important ones to know about. But many of the QOL tools are too
cumbersome to use in day to day practice. We are in dire need of a easy
to use clinical tool that is validated for assessment of patient
reported outcomes. And again, the number of papers I've reviewed where
people have reported CAEP scores as one of the outcome measures in
response to treatments. That is not what it's designed for, for example,
you can never get lower than C5. You can never get better than a healed
ulcer. So again, that's the important distinction.

### Evaluation

**When we do see patients in clinic with chronic venous insufficiency,
which type of imaging modalities should we use to investigate the
function and the anatomy of the lower limbs?**

If a patient comes to clinic, we can't underestimate the importance of
the clinical assessment. And when you assess these patients, you really
looking for two things, you are looking for the impact of their venous
disease on their quality of life and the impact of the venous disease
has on their normal function.

But also you're looking for complications of venous disease. This is a
clinical assessment. But then when ordering investigations, you really
want to identify underlying treatable causes of their venous disease.
And that's the goal of any investigation.

Venous duplex imaging is obviously the first line, gold standard that
pretty much anybody will go to around the world. And what that does is
essentially gives you information about the flow, both in the normal
antegrade, but also retrograde or refluxing flow in superficial and deep
veins.

It'll give you information about the anatomy of the veins , which will
help you to plan treatment, but it also gives you lots of other
information as well. It gives you information in the common femoral
vein, for example, if there's good phasicity of flow or if there's no
scarring. It helps you to evaluate whether there might be some outflow
obstruction, so duplex imaging is the absolute first line, gold
standard. For more on venous duplex scanning, see \@ref(venous).

Now, once you've done theduplex imaging, if there's clinical suspicion,
then of course we can move on to other investigations. So proximal CTV,
MRV, venography, IVUS, all sorts of other weird and wonderful things.
But clinical assessments and duplex assessment are the bedrock of every
assessment of every venous patient. So that's the foundation.

### Treatment

**Moving on to the treatment of superficial disease. When we talk about
treatment of superficial venous incompetence, I don't think we can
really get away from talking about the two major studies, the
ESCHAR[**@gohel2007] **and the EVRA[**@gohel2018] **studies, which I
know you've been involved with. Can you review what these studies showed
and their importance in the care of our patients.**

Before I go into the trials, 'm just going to go back a step and just
talk about the general mindset that's important for these patients. So
what we're treating with these patients is not superficial venous
reflux. What we're treating is chronic venous hypertension. So we're
treating a global pathophysiological entity of which the superficial
reflux is one correctable factor. And the reason that's important is
that there may be other correctable factors, such as venous outflow
obstruction or other sort of mobility related things can be adjusted.

But they're also going to be lots of uncorrectable factors, such as poor
mobility, heart failure, dependency, ankle stiffness. If your ankle is
stiff, you can't use your calf muscle to pump effectively. You don't
have that mechanism for clearing the pressure out of your legs. So the
success of these treatments, particularly for the ulcer population, has
to be taken in the context of treating venous hypertension as well.

Having said that the aim of these trials was really very simple. Most
patients with venous ulceration have got superficial reflux. So what is
the role of treating the superficial reflux? That's the simple question
that was asked by these trials.

So the ESCHAR trial recruited between 1999 and 2002, 500 patients with
healed and open leg ulcers. They either randomized to compression or
compression and traditional, superficial venous surgery, stripping or
ligation. And that trial was very clear. It showed that with venous
stripping there wasn't a benefit for healing, but there was a
significant and sizable reduction in the risk of ulcer
recurrence.[@gohel2007]

So one of the criticisms of ESCHAR was lots of people didn't have the
same surgery. Lots of people had just ligation alone, et cetera. We
don't really do stripping anymore, it's all endovenous. So EVRA really
aimed to bring the ESCHAR trial up to modern practice. We randomized 450
patients with open leg ulcers to early endovenous treatments, delivered
within two weeks versus a more delayed approach. What EVRA showed, again
is common sense, if you do with the underlying problem, the venous
ulceration healed significantly quicker.[@gohel2018]

So put them together clear, unequivocal argument for treating the
superficial reflux in these patients as quickly as possible.

**Can you broadly outline the different treatment options that can be
offered to patients with superficial venous reflex?**

I have counted about 42 different ways of murdering a saphenous vein.
Long and short of it, there are lots of different treatment options. Do
something that you're trained in and proficient with and something
that's appropriate. Thermal ablation is in the NICE guidance and in lots
of other international guideline documents has been combined, whether
it's radiofrequency or laser. Although foam sclerotherapy therapy, when
studied in randomized trials, has lower technical success rates and
lower vein closure rates, the clinical success rates in terms of healing
are just as good. This sort of five, six, even 10% reduction in closing
the vein, doesn't really seem to translate into a significant drop in
clinical effectiveness.

So I think the most important thing is not necessarily what you use,
it's doing it quickly and delivering it to the people that need it.

**When we are consenting patients for endovenous intervention, what
risks should we discuss with the patient and that they need to be aware
of?**

You can spend an hour doing this, if you're being very diligent. But
what I say to patients are that there are generic risks of venous
thromboembolism is the risk of any intervention. And I think that's
worthy of specific discussion after endovenous procedures, but I quote a
risk of around one in 200 for most endovenous interventions.

There's always a risk of bruising. And if you do phlebectomies, what I
often tell people is that bruising sometimes looks worse than it feels.
And with the thermal interventions in particular, I think the risk of
nerve related complications, so some numbness or some nerve pain, are
worthy of mentioned, and of course the risk of recurrence.

Foam sclerotherapy has a different mechanism of action. It's a detergent
that's injected into the vein that kills the endothelium. And there are
some people that have associated foam sclerotherapy with some
neurological events. So a very large registry that was organized by the
manufacturers of STS recently looked at 10,000 patients in the UK and
found very few events-around one in 4-5,000. Some people say that if
there is a history of migraine, then the risk of these neurological
events might be a little bit higher.

So, a little bit of caution, although in practice, I've treated many
people with migraines. But if you believe the literature, one in four or
five, people have got a little ASD and obviously we treated lots of
those people, so the risks are very low but it's just important to have
that discussion beforehand.

**Are there any techniques that we can use to mitigate some of these
risks?**

So I think VTE is something that is really worth specifically
discussing. I t's a very rare event after superficial venous
interventions, but it's potentially catastrophic. It's newspaper worthy,
if young people end up having a very bad outcome. What we've got to
realize is that the rate of VTE events is very low, there are almost
certainly some people that have got a higher risk. And so what we've got
to get slightly smarter about is identifying the people that have a
higher risk of VTE and maybe giving them prolonged course of
thromboprophylaxis, as well as appropriate counseling and mitigation as
well.

So it's about getting smarter about risk assessment. The current risk
assessment tools are not really fit for purpose when it comes to
superficial venous intervention. So the department of health or the
Caprini tools don't really take into account some of the really
important factors that I think do impact on VTE risk after superficial
venous interventions.

There's nothing validated, there's nothing widely available, but we have
a local, specific risk assessment for patients having superficial venous
interventions. There are major risk factors we look out for, such as
previous ipsilateral VTE, active malignancy, but also significant
chronic inflammatory conditions (i.e. inflammatory bowel disease), these
patients have a much higher risk of VTE than we previously recognized.
There are also minor factors, superficial vein thrombosis, obesity,
comorbidities. All of these things are put together and we come out with
a score. For patients above a certain threshold, they get offered
extended rivaroxaban or low molecular weight heparin. So then we can get
smarter.

In addition, it is important to implement mitigation. So traditionally
things like a contraceptive pill, HRT and Tamoxifen, we wouldn't usually
stop them for a local anesthetic procedure, but being on an estrogen
containing pill doubles or triples your risk of VTE. It's an easily
reversible thing in the short term that can be done. So for my patients,
I would normally recommend that we stop the pill a full cycle before,
and similarly a month before and after the procedure.

**You mentioned it an extended course of anticoagulation for those
patients with risk factors. Is there a specific timescale locally that
you use for this?**

The venous forum produced some guidance the year before last in exactly
this area. We often only do about a week or 10 days for a lot of these
patients. However, if there's an ongoing, persistent risk factor, then
actually the VTE risk persists for four to six weeks, and thus there may
be an argument for up to six weeks of therapy in particularly high risk
patients.

However, if they are really that high risk, you've really got to
question whether a superficial venous intervention is needed, balancing
the risks and the benefits. But since for some patients the high risk
period persists for at least another six weeks afterwards, be careful
not to stop prophylaxis too soon.

**Moving on to a more specific question about treatment, what is the
role for treating and competent perforator veins in these patients?**

So the facetious answer is it depends on how much you're being
reimbursed for them. But \~\~the, ~~the clinical answer is~~ , um,\~\~
relatively little ~~in,~~ in my practice and ~~in,~~ in most sensible
practices. ~~Um, so, so look, if we scan, so~~ the more advanced the
venous disease, the more likely you are for the disease to be recurrent,
the more likely there is to be deep venous disease or posts from the
disease.

And the more likely you are to finding competent perforators. So the
more advanced the venous disease, all of these things are more likely.
So ~~if you manage these,~~ if you imagine these patients with being ,
it is very common to find perforators. \~\~Um, ~~and if you take a sort
of super aggressive role saying you've got to obliterate every single
bit of reflux you can find~~ , well,\~\~ then you'd be doing a couple of
perforators and every single patient.

\~\~Um, \~\~and that is the approach of a number of centers around the
world. \~\~Um, \~\~the pragmatic reality is number one, if you ablate
the superficial reflux, we know that a lot of these perforators actually
become competent because we've got rid of the outflow or you've changed
the dynamics in some other way. And they've become
competent.$$00:20:00$$

Even if they've stayed in competence, the clinical benefit is still
there and is usually still pretty durable. Now, of course, there may be
some people that develop recurrent problems and then there can be a more
targeted approach to the perforator. ~~So I personally, and~~ the ESCO
and Everest studies did not target perforators at all.

And the outcomes in the Everest study was the best healing rate of any
published prospective Lego study. \~\~So, \~\~so putting all that
together, it's difficult to make a case for aggressive treatment of
perforators first up. \~\~Um, \~\~having said that for some people with
recurrent disease, it's not uncommon to have a big mid thigh Ontarian
perforator, or, \~\~you know, \~\~big cockpits perforated, lower Pronto
down on the medial side.

\~\~So, uh, you know, \~\~I do treat perforators, but almost always it's
in recurrent disease with recurrence or deteriorating symptoms.

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* so we've discussed quite a bit
about endo venous intervention. \~\~Um, \~\~is there a rule for open
surgery in some patients?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** ~~So~~ interesting. ~~So~~ open surgery
remains the most commonly used superficial venous intervention around
the world. And there are still lots of centers in the UK that
$$00:21:00$$ primarily offer open surgery\~\~ , um,\~\~ and\~\~ ,
um,\~\~ being balanced. It's a very effective treatments if you do it
well, if you use\~\~ , uh,\~\~ modern approaches tumescent anesthesia
ultrasound guidance, then actually some of the traditional issues with
open surgery, which are often technical and complication related, don't
really apply.

Having said that all the randomized trials have shown the same thing
while the effectiveness may be as good in open surgery done well, the
recovery is much better after intravenous ablation. So it's difficult to
make the case for open surgery when you've got something that is so
well-established and the competition was just so low.

And it's cheaper when you look at their theater capacity, et cetera.
\~\~So, \~\~so \~\~I think, \~\~I think there has to be a steady drift
towards endovenous, but there are lots of things stopping this. \~\~I
mean, \~\~in Germany, for example, the reimbursement is greatest rope
and surgery. So surprise, surprise. There are still lots and lots of
open varicose vein operations.

And again, for you guys, if you're going to change practice, the single
biggest $$00:22:00$$ driver for change in practice is reimbursement.
\~\~Um, \~\~you know, if you can, you can change where the money goes.
You can change whatever you like. \~\~Um, so, you know, \~\~and the
final thing is \~\~I've, \~\~I've treated maybe three in the last five
years.

I've three patients with open surgery. One was a GP who I had treated
the other leg with open surgery a few years earlier, and she said, I
want the same operation, please. So I did struggle to argue with that.
The other two were big saffron, the viruses in the groin, \~\~you know,
\~\~three, four, five centimeters suffered at mercy.

So specific indications. But not really for most patients,

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** I suppose that comes on to training as
well the UK. If Australia's, aren't doing as much open surgery, then,
\~\~you know, ~~conceivably over time that we're going to lose those
skills of being able to do~~ , uh, \~\~sadness, cutdown or stripping.

**manj_gohel - denoise:** \~\~it's such a shame, Andrew, \~\~it's such a
shame. \~\~It's, \~\~it's the operation that I learned how to operate
with. \~\~You know, it's, it's, it's, \~\~it's a beautiful anatomical
operation. \~\~Um, \~\~and you learn so much, \~\~you know, \~\~respect
for tissues and handling blood vessels. And it's great preparation.
\~\~So, \~\~so it's with a heavy heart that I'm \~\~sort \~\~telling
trainees that, \~\~you know, \~\~you shouldn't be doing this cause it's
such a great training operation.

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** \~\~Um, \~\~ so we've talked about
$$00:23:00$$ intravenous and surgical treatment. \~\~Um, ~~but are there
any pharmacological therapies that can be used~~ , um,\~\~ in patients
with chronic venous insufficiency?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** ~~We are , um,~~ we're pretty skeptical in the
UK. \~\~Um, ~~when it comes to Vino active or pharmacological
treatments~~ , uh,\~\~ if you go to Europe\~\~ , um, \~\~they love them.
\~\~They, \~\~they sell like hot cakes. They're over the counter in a
lot of pharmacies. \~\~Um, \~\~and it's interesting. So \~\~the, ~~the
drug with probably the most evidence is something called Naflon~~ ,
um,\~\~ law and micronized purified flavonoid fraction.

So flavonoids on naturally occurring\~\~ , um,\~\~ Vino active
compounds. Are there a whole variety of, because effects\~\~ , um,\~\~
only some of which we understand, but a lot of studies have shown
improvements in Adima improvement in heaviness. \~\~Um, \~\~and Def lawn
is marketed by a French company and it's got good evidence, but they do
not see places like the UK as a big enough market because of our
inherent skepticism over these sort of things.

To make it worth their while to go through the\~\~ , um,\~\~ the
marketing and the regulatory stuff. So it's not available. \~\~So, um,
~~but patients that have~~ $$00:24:00$$ gone to France and picked it up
over the counter , um,\~\~ have said it works well. So there may be a
rolling and pen toxifying and these other things. So that there's some
good evidence \~\~that, \~\~that accelerates healing of leg ulcers.

\~\~Um, \~\~I don't think we're very receptive in the UK in general. So
not in the vascular surgery community ~~to , um,~~ to be \~\~sort of
\~\~pharmacological or herbal time remedies.

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* nice recommends that we should
undertake\~\~ , uh,\~\~ treatment for varicose veins to improve a
patient's quality of life. But currently within the NHS and not all\~\~
, uh,\~\~ CCGs will actually fund this.

What's your views on this particular subject?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** \~\~So, um, \~\~ I'll try and answer the
question without swearing. ~~Um, it it's, it , uh,~~ over the years I've
had so many frustrating interactions with CCGs. ~~Um, so~~ the
commissioners that fund varicose vein treatment, ~~so~~ the whole point
of nice is to give centralized guidance. So there can be some
consistency of care and provision across the country.

\~\~Um, \~\~but again, the problem is with the funding and the CCGs hold
the budgets and they have differing rules and in general, There has been
a tendency over many years to try and resist $$00:25:00$$ funding,
varicose vein treatments. \~\~Um, ~~so my view is that CCGs should
follow the nice guidance~~ , uh,\~\~ and a lot of these patients should
be offered treatment.

\~\~Um, ~~the other comments I'd make is that even the CCGs are, do
offer treatment~~ , um,\~\~ there is still \~\~a, \~\~a big ~~missing,~~
missing piece, which is \~\~the, \~\~the treatment mindset and the
pathway. So it's no good having a document that says, yes, if you have a
venous leg ulcer, you can have varicose vein treatment. If the pathways
don't encourage referral, if the education level of the primary care
nurses and the GPS isn't there.

\~\~Um, \~\~if \~\~the, \~\~the hospital is providing the treatments,
provides a resistance to seeing and assessing these patients and all of
these things are happening across the country. \~\~So, um, \~\~I think,
\~\~you know, you, ~~you look at arterial disease~~ , um,\~\~ and.
There's so much controversy over a lot of the treatments that we're
providing.

\~\~You know, \~\~you look at \~\~the, the, \~\~the debate and the
challenge of aortic aneurism treatments recently, et cetera. \~\~I mean,
\~\~the treatment of Erika Spain disease is unquestionable indisputed
\~\~it was it's \~\~it's clearly evidence-based, it's low hanging fruit.
~~It~~ not only is it cost $$00:26:00$$ effective, it saves money. So
it's very frustrating that there's not more pathways.

And I think \~\~this is, \~\~this is part of \~\~the, ~~the ongoing work
that we all have to do both people at your level, but also obviously
enthusiasts like me and other advocates to try and just keep the message
going and keep it going then. And final, quick comment I'd make is about
COVID and~~ , um,\~\~ the associated challenges to funding.

\~\~Um, \~\~so at the moment there's a bit of a blank check approach to
healthcare. It's not going to last ~~guys, it's going to,~~ there's
going to be a time when ~~some~~ somebody in government says, okay, so
we need to now start trying to balance the books. I can already tell you
now that one of the first things that's going to get attacked is
superficial venous treatments and varicose veins.

\~\~So, \~\~so we've just got to get our arguments ready and be prepared
for this ongoing battle that's been there for as long as I've been
adopted.

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* What are the healthcare costs
associated with the lower extremity venous disease?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** \~\~um, \~\~honest answers. We don't know.
\~\~Um, \~\~there have been a number of studies that have looked at
venous ulceration and the impact of $$00:27:00$$ venous ulceration, and
there's \~\~sort of \~\~guesstimates that people have put together
educated guesstimates in the UK. NHS is around 2 billion pounds a year.
So UK NHS, budget's about a hundred, 120 billion.

\~\~So, you know, \~\~up to about 2% of the budget, \~\~you know, big
bucks, \~\~big bucks, and that's just C6 disease. ~~You know, we
haven't,~~ we're not even going into all of the other diseases, the
associated cellulitis, but also not only the healthcare costs, but the
societal costs, \~\~you know, \~\~the time off work, the other things.

And then of course the superficial vein thrombosis and the VTE and
August other associates, it's a massive underestimate

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** you mentioned superficial vein thrombosis.
They're also known as superficial thrombophlebitis. \~\~Um, \~\~just a
few words on it. What is it and how do you manage it?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** I'm very easy to use both terms because I'm
going to take the opportunity to encourage robustly the use of
superficial vein thrombosis rather than thrombophlebitis. The problem
with thrombophlebitis is it is too closely associated with an effective
etiology and effective pathology. And I can only imagine how
$$00:28:00$$ many useless courses of antibiotics have been prescribed.

For the treatment of what has been presumed to be an infected properly.
Of course, there's no infection, \~\~it's a, \~\~it's a thrombus in the
superficial vein. \~\~Um, \~\~and I think what's really important is
that traditionally it's been seen as just a bit of a nuisance and let's
not worry about it and, \~\~you know, \~\~analgesia and
anti-inflammatories, and you'll be fine.

\~\~Um, \~\~it's a \~\~really, \~\~really sinister pathology. It's an
important cause of VTE. \~\~And, \~\~and again, if you think about it,
think of how many thousands, millions of people that are with varicose
veins. \~\~Um, \~\~they don't all get clots in their varicose veins.
~~You know, this is these people,~~ they've all got stasis to a certain
extent.

They don't get clots. So ~~it's~~ more than just the flow dynamics is
going on here. These people are thrombogenic. They have a thrombogenic
innate quality that leads to this\~\~ , um,\~\~ and that's shown out in
the study. \~\~So, um, ~~some really good work in some French studies~~
, um,\~\~ where they identified patients who were scanned with
superficial vein thrombosis, And a quarter of them on their first duplex
scan had a DVT, so supervision for most of the quarterly
DVT.$$00:29:00$$

And a lot of these DBTs were remotes from superficial vein thrombosis.
So they're all extending into the deep vein they were remote. And again,
\~\~you know, \~\~confirming this idea that actually a thrombogenic
problem is going on here. ~~Um, and so what we~~ send the latest CSPs
guidelines, there is quite a lot of stuff about SVT treatment
algorithms.

And again, I would urge people to have a look at that, and it's
important to risk stratify people. The closer you are to the junction,
the higher VTE risk, and actually for anyone other than just a bit of
clotting of Erik hostility, anticoagulation is the treatment of choice
to reduce progression to BTU.

So again, I won't go into lots and lots of detail, but look at the
guidelines. It's very clear what we should be doing with these people.
Evidence-based and then once the anticoagulation is done, They needs to
be rescanned and that residual incompetent, scarred thrombogenic\~\~ ,
uh,\~\~ Safa Spain needs to be ablated.

Otherwise they'll recur. So a real change in mindset and level of
$$00:30:00$$ aggression.

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** ~~Right. So, um, So in terms of questions,
we've sort of exhausted our, what we'd already written about superficial
venous disease. I suppose the question now is, do we talk, do we move on
to talk about deep venous thrombosis? Um, it depends on timing for
yourself, Mr. Goa.~~

**manj_gohel - denoise:** ~~so I'm, I'm happy to guys, I'm happy to just
carry on. Um, and, and then I'll leave it to you guys to work out what
you want to do. Um, whether you want to do a sort of a best of both and
combining it into one, or whether the split to, I mean, I'll leave that
honestly, up to you guys. Um, I don't, I don't, I don't want to be too
greedy and have two different sort of.~~

~~Things just with me talking, but I'll be, I'll be guided by you.
Whatever's going to be most useful.~~

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* ~~Yeah, I think the thing that
feeling is probably two podcasts would be the best way to do this. Um,
do you think we should talk about bleeding, varicose veins as well as
part of this,~~

~~because it's something which you do see, I think this is something
which we do see , uh, and it's just maybe putting a bit of
evidence-based behind how we should be treating that.~~

**manj_gohel - denoise:** ~~Yeah, absolutely. Um, so ask me a question,
Amanda.~~

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* ~~yeah.~~ What's your approach to
managing patients with bleeding, varicose veins, Mr. Google.

**manj_gohel - denoise:** Really important question. It is a vascular
emergency. ~~Um, so~~ there are several depressing reports of patients
having died from bleeding, from a very costly and is often elderly
patients who are frail, who have arthritis in their hips. And therefore
can't bend down to press on\~\~ , um,\~\~ the bleeding are costly down
by the ankle and also.

\~\~Um, ~~and actually there's some very~~ , um,\~\~ grim photos\~\~ ,
um,\~\~ in various case reports and\~\~ it's , um, ~~it's really sad.
There's two or three photos that I've seen where an elderly~~ , um,
\~\~patient has not wanted to wake their partner. \~\~Um, \~\~and so has
gone and laid down in the bath with this bleeding vein that they
couldn't control and basically exsanguinated.

\~\~Um, \~\~so \~\~it's a, \~\~it's a vascular emergency. \~\~Um,
\~\~and these patients should be seen and assessed and the superficial
venous disease should be dealt with as soon as possible. Ideally, when
they're assessed as an emergency. \~\~And as you know, \~\~ we had an
emergency clinic running throughout COVID ~~in there.~~ And anyone with
bleeding veins have the $$00:31:00$$ same urgency as the CLI patients.

\~\~Um, ~~and they were treated there. And then~~ , uh,\~\~ in terms of
the treatment, there's two aspects. So you want to decompress ~~the ,
um,~~ the venous hypertension by ablating, the saphenous reflux, but the
specific bleeding area. I think there's a real case for some local foam
sclerotherapy. \~\~Um, ~~you want to block off that vulnerable bleeding
vein~~ , um,\~\~ and to ensure that this doesn't happen again\~\~ ,
but,\~\~ but again, \~\~you know, ~~if anyone receives a referral~~ ,
um,\~\~ these are \~\~sort of \~\~people to see straight away.

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* So let's move on to discuss deep
venous thrombosis. You're recently involved \~\~in the , uh, \~\~in the
European society of vascular surgery, venous thrombosis guidelines,
~~Mr. GoHealth , um,~~ in the most part, cough DBTs are managed by
medical teams or dedicated DVT services within the hospital. So in this
section, we'll be focusing mostly on proximal DVT in medical school.

We've learned a lot about varicose triad and the etiology of venous
thrombosis. Does that simple concept still hold true today.

**manj_gohel - denoise:** \~\~um, \~\~ I think it does. \~\~Um,
\~\~okay. There's a few caveats and a few nuances, but I think the
principle that the flow, the vessel $$00:32:00$$ wall, the blood
constituents are the main factors that affect whether or not you get
thrombosis \~\~in, in a, \~\~in a vein is still pretty solid. ~~Um, of
course it's much more nuanced than the again.~~

\~\~So you, you, \~\~ you kindly gave me a lot of credit for these
guidelines. It was as a massive team efforts, and it's great to have
experts from around Europe, multidisciplinary experts. You've got to
realize that a lot of vascular surgeons aren't really that involved with
DVT management. So having, \~\~you know, \~\~professors of hematology
and internal medicine, \~\~it was, it was, you know, \~\~It was feisty.

\~\~Um, \~\~but it was \~\~very, you know, \~\~really good experience.
\~\~Um, \~\~so yeah, burqas tried \~\~very, ~~very valid~~ , but,\~\~
but also real changes in mindset about the whole idea of provoked and
unprovoked DVT\~\~ , um, which , uh, we may come on to, but I think
\~\~again, I would urge people \~\~to, \~\~to look at some of the new
areas that we've covered in these guidelines.

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** You mentioned there about\~\~ , um,\~\~
potential risk factors for DVT, and that can be classified into these
provoked, which can be transient or persistent and then unprovoked risk
factors. Can you talk about some of the specific factors and causes

**manj_gohel - denoise:** \~\~Yeah, of course. So, um, \~\~in general,
what's been happening for several years \~\~is, \~\~is a $$00:33:00$$
recognition that there are some DVCS that happened with a clear
provoking factor. \~\~So, you know, \~\~the communist major. Transient
provoking fats with something like surgery, for example. So a lot of DVT
is, are called, \~\~you know, ~~with that clear provoking factor, but
there's an enormous population of people that don't have a clear
provoking planter at all, or have this sort of~~ , um, \~\~minor factor
that may or may not have contributed.

\~\~Um, and, and what we've. \~\~So traditionally there's been a
dichotomy between provoked and unprovoked. If it's provoked, they get a
limited period of anticoagulation is unprovoked it's long-term, ~~that's
been the dichotomous station.~~ And certainly the last big thrombosis
guidelines was the ACP guidelines, the American chest guidelines, and
that's what they suggested.

\~\~Um, \~\~but it's much more nuanced than that. And what we've got to
remember is that there are some provoked DBTs where there's much higher
risk, and those are there's some unprovoked DBTs, which actually there
may be other factors that you need to take into account. So I think for
those people that are interested in this area, it's really important
\~\~to, \~\~to get to the nitty gritty.

So $$00:34:00$$ long-winded way of answering your question. Major
provokes would be surgery, major trauma, but minor provoked are those
sorts of minor bits of immobility. \~\~You know, \~\~if you've been in
bed for a couple of days with flu, but is that a provoking pattern or
not? We don't really know things like being on the contraceptive pill.

So yes, if you've only just started it, that would be considered a
provoking factor, but there are some people that have been on the pill
for two or three years and then get a DBT. Can we really say that's a
provoking factor? \~\~So, \~\~and again, a guideline document is a big,
long list of other things where for people to think about it and
consider.

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** and in those patients where after you've
taken a thorough history, \~\~there \~\~there's no obvious provoking
factors. Is there a role for screening for occult malignancies and
thrombophilias.

**manj_gohel - denoise:** ~~um, so~~ there was a big trend. \~\~So,
\~\~so thrombophilia testing the history of it's really interesting.
~~So~~ when they were first identified and our ability to screen them
first became available\~\~ , um,\~\~ there's a lot of excitement because
people thought, yes, we're going to be able to identify a clear cause
for all of these unprovoked $$00:35:00$$ DBTs.

And the reality is at least 50% of them, there's no identifiable
thrombophilia. So what it almost suddenly means is there's lots of
thrombophilias that we haven't yet identified we can't test for. \~\~Um,
\~\~so it hasn't really been the panacea in that regard. \~\~Um, \~\~and
the other pragmatic reality for the thrombophilias is that if we're
going to be putting people on long-term anticoagulation anyway, the
additional value of testing for these things is really very minimal.

And the ones that are really important. No, the homozygous, the
antithrombin, the homozygous rectify me. The thrombosis history is so
stark that they normally smack you in the face. \~\~So, \~\~so I think
it's generally gone out of fashion. And again, there's only very
specific circumstances where we would suggest testing them.

If you're going to be trying to stop anticoagulation. For some reason,
\~\~you know, ~~patients don't want to be on it, or if there's bleeding
risks or other things, then there might be an argument there for some
sort of risk stratification, but also there's a clear family history.
And then it might~~ then be what I think would \~\~be worth excluding
some of the more sinister thrombophilias, but otherwise, $$00:36:00$$
certainly not a role for routine testing \~\~and, \~\~and similarly for
malignancy.

\~\~Um, \~\~so unprovoked DVT, the prevalence of an underlying
malignancy that studies have been done between six and 10%. \~\~Um,
\~\~and the studies that have looked at an aggressive, thorough
assessment process rather than a more selective process. Have picked up
a few more cancers, but the additional cost in terms of anxiety,
additional investigations, et cetera, and no demonstrable improvement in
outcome has meant that the guidelines have not recommended routine
\~\~screening \~\~cancer screening ~~rather than so~~ the recommended
approaches are much more selective sex specific screening.

\~\~Um, \~\~it's a PSA breast assessments, that sort of thing, rather
than a, \~\~you know, \~\~CT, every bit of them, \~\~you know, \~\~all
the time. \~\~So \~\~

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* ~~What~~ What is the algorithm for
investigation?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** ~~so~~ it's a really good question because
most vascular surgeons don't have a clue about \~\~sort of
\~\~algorithms because they're all done by a nice ~~strong boast~~ nurse
led thrombosis clinic in our $$00:37:00$$ hospitals. \~\~And \~\~again,
~~it's,~~ I think it's important that we understand how these algorithms
work. So the most important components.

Is the first component of the algorithm, which is an assessment of the
pre-test probability of DVT. So anyone who comes with a DVT, you can go
through a validated\~\~ , um, \~\~tool. And the most common is the
Wells, ~~a~~ probability school, which would all have heard of series of
questions and give you an indication as to whether a DVT is likely or
unlikely.

If a DVT is likely, then the algorithm is to do a scan, very
straightforward. If a DVT is unlikely, then the algorithm is to do a D
dimer. Because if that is negative, DVT is excluded 30 to go anywhere
near a scan, no confusion. \~\~Um, \~\~and so there is, and again, the
guidelines are very clear on the assessment process, but a lot of this
won't reach our radars as vascular specialists at all until the DVT has
been diagnosed.

So we don't appreciate the importance of the $$00:38:00$$ early stages.
\~\~Um, \~\~So again, have a quick plug for the guidelines. Again,
there's a very nice algorithm, beautiful colors. I definitely recommend
having a look.

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** so the exact choice and duration of
anticoagulation in the management of a DVT is probably beyond the scope
of this podcast, but on the whole are DOACs preferred over vitamin K
antagonists, such as warfarin and why.

**manj_gohel - denoise:** ~~Um, so~~ in a word, yes. \~\~Um, so lots and
\~\~lots and lots of studies funded by big companies that make DOACs
have been done and they've all shown fairly consistent things. ~~So~~
they've shown that the DOACs are as effective as the vitamin K
antagonists\~\~ , um,\~\~ at preventing DVT. So preventing recurrent
DVT. So they're as effective in terms of anticoagulation.

They have almost always a significantly lower. Bleeding risk, but
they've got this enormous added convenience of not needing regular blood
tests, et cetera, not having this dietary\~\~ , um, \~\~effect that the
vitamin K antagonists can have and, \~\~you know, \~\~the $$00:39:00$$
erratic control, et cetera. \~\~So, \~\~so the general direction of
travel is inexorably towards more and more use of dialects.

~~Um, so~~ a couple of other areas where darks are really Shaun. ~~So~~
the tendency is to recommend longer courses of anticoagulation and often
indefinite anticoagulation. a number of studies, both rivaroxaban and
apixaban have looked at the effect of a lower dose of Dohuk in these
patients. So if you need to extend anticoagulation, can you use a lower
dose, a prophylactic dose, so 10 milligrams of rivaroxaban or two and a
half BD of a pixel.

And. The results have been \~\~really, \~\~really impressive because the
prevention of recurrent VTE is very good to the same as the therapeutic
dose, but the bleeding risk is much lower. So you've got this additional
benefit of being able to give an Eva load those with even lower bleeding
risk. \~\~Um, \~\~and the additional, \~\~the sort of the, \~\~the real
icing on the cake for the deluxe has been a few recent studies that have
been looking at cancer patients.

~~Um, so~~ traditionally cancer patients where, ~~you know,~~
$$00:40:00$$ low-molecular weight heparin only, not for DOACs. \~\~Um,
~~there's not enough evidence~~ , but,\~\~ but the hopper size study and
the Caravaggio study more recently have both looked at the docks or ban.
And I think apixaban in the context of cancer and have shown that
actually they're very effective.

\~\~So, you know, ~~almost all of the. Areas~~ , um,\~\~ DOACs are
demonstrating their superiority. \~\~Um, um, ~~the one very notable
exception is antiphospholipid syndrome, particularly triple positive
antiphospholipid syndrome. This is a pretty nasty acquired
thrombophilia~~ , um,\~\~ which is\~\~ , um, \~\~where warfarin is still
the gold standard.

\~\~So, \~\~but pretty much everything else is done.

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* patients with a proximal DVT. So a
DVT in the eyes of your femoral or the femoral popliteal segment. Is
there a role for elastic compression in the acute phase?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** \~\~So, um, \~\~ traditionally people have
been a bit nervous about putting compression on patients with acute DVT,
\~\~you know, sort of \~\~ concerns about causing propagation and
causing PEs and all this sort of stuff. \~\~Um, so, um, ~~again, a very
important study was the ideal DVT study~~ , um, ~~run by a series of
Dutch colleagues~~ , um,\~\~ and a number of other additional
$$00:41:00$$ studies more recently that have built on the original idea
of DBT study.

And \~\~that the, \~\~the short answer to your question is that early
compression is \~\~really, \~\~really, really important. It's a really
positive thing to do within 24 hours and it's proper compression and
it's not just the Ted stocking and see what happens. It's 30 to 40
millimeters of mercury. So that in practice is a class two stocking with
a bandage on top.

\~\~Um, \~\~and the benefits are reduces the early pain and swelling of
the DVT, but also interestingly, It reduces the risk of post-thrombotic
syndrome. \~\~So, \~\~so again, let me say that again. So if you put
compression on early, it reduces the risk of them developing
post-thrombotic syndrome. So a lot of focus has been on clearing the
vein and early thrombus removal and thrombolysis and thrombectomy and
all this sort of aggressive stuff.

But just by doing the compression, we can have at least part of the same
effect and we've just not been doing it. \~\~And, \~\~and, \~\~you know,
\~\~you guys know in the hospitals, \~\~there's, you know, very,
\~\~very rarely do these patients get proper compression. \~\~Um, \~\~so
again, there's a $$00:42:00$$ big section in the ESPs guidelines about
the role of compression and our group with them as to when to use it.

How long do you use it for? \~\~Um, \~\~and what we want to see now is
the DVT pathways around the country, around the world, updated and
amended with this latest guidance.

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* one of the concerning
complications of a DBT, particularly a proximal DVT is post-thrombotic
syndrome. Can you recap the symptoms of PTs and how it's diagnosed?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** yes, of course. \~\~So, um, it's, \~\~it's a
fairly amorphous entity PTs. ~~It's a , um,~~ it's a series of\~\~ ,
um,\~\~ Patient symptoms and clinical signs that develop after deep vein
thrombosis. \~\~Um, \~\~that's deliberately very vague because the
condition is so variable. \~\~Um, \~\~and in terms of diagnosing PTs,
\~\~I mean ~~the official diagnostic tool is~~ , um,\~\~ a score of five
or more on the scale, but to is another one of these\~\~ , um,\~\~ tools
that have been developed for\~\~ , um, \~\~measuring both making a
diagnosis, but also assessing progression of PTs.

\~\~Um, ~~but in terms of sort of centers, people get swelling,
heaviness pain, there's~~ $$00:43:00$$ a very unique symptom, which has
been this good occasion , um,\~\~ which is almost pathic and monic of
post-thrombotic syndrome will venous outflow obstruction. And it's
\~\~this, ~~this is pain~~ , uh,\~\~ which has a bursting tenths quality
in the calf on exertion.

Which does settle on stopping, but it takes a lot longer than ideal
publication. So sometimes people will take half an hour to get better.
The link has to be elevated. So that's been as qualification and that's
often the most disabling symptom. \~\~Uh, \~\~but of course, people can
develop the same sort of clinical complications than you can with any
venous disease.

\~\~Um, uh, \~\~skin changes, hyper Dematic sclerosis, venous leg
ulcers, et cetera. \~\~So, \~\~so \~\~that's, \~\~that's PTs and it's
\~\~up to \~\~up to 50%, probably closer to 25% of proximal DVT.

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** ~~um, before we move on to talking about
post-thrombotic syndrome,~~ a quick question about\~\~ , uh,\~\~ IVC
filters as vascular surgeons, we sometimes get asked about the
appropriate limits of inserting an IVC filter. When would you consider
one and how long can one stay in situ for.

**manj_gohel - denoise:** \~\~Um, \~\~so short answers virtually never,
and as soon as possible. \~\~Um, so, \~\~but \~\~let's, ~~let's expand
on that a~~ $$00:44:00$$ little bit. So the history of IVC filters is a
painful story , um,\~\~ particularly in the U S super aggressive use of
IVC filters. \~\~Um, \~\~very few of them retrieve lots of IVC,
occlusions, major lawsuits against big companies.

\~\~So, you know, \~\~very sorry story. \~\~Um, \~\~and that's led to a
worldwide. Reluctance to use IVC filter. So probably in some cases we
should be using them. We haven't been using them, but the traditional
~~sort of~~ indications and reasons for using IVC filters included weird
and wonderful things like floating thrombus and \~\~you know, \~\~other
factors.

\~\~Um, \~\~the reality is the only real indication that we could come
up with was when there's a proximal DVT, and there's a clear
contra-indication to anticoagulation. So if there's no anticoagulation,
then the risk of propagation of P is reasonably high. So a temporary IVC
filter in that case, there's a strong case for if a patient is
anticoagulated.

\~\~Very, \~\~very rarely can the case be made for an IVC filter. Very
rarely. And $$00:45:00$$ I don't want to go into nuanced details. \~\~I
mean, \~\~there's a, there a weird and wonderful is where somebody
already had a PE there's right. Heart strain. There may be some
anatomical features that you're worried about there. Their anticoagulant
control is borderline, \~\~you know, there might be, \~\~there might be
specific cases, but this is really very rare.

Most people don't until quite late. You do not need an IVC filter.

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* so clot burden reduction
techniques are a hot topic at the moment. Before we talk about endo
Venus techniques, is there a real full surgical Venus thrombectomy? And
when would you consider this?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** ~~Yeah. So, so~~ open thrombectomy is part of
the spectrum of early thrombus removal techniques. It used to be very
popular, a very satisfying technique. I think I've done it three times.
They've all been for the same sort of indication, which is flag Amaziah
severe limb threatening\~\~ , um,\~\~ post DVT change. And in a patient
where they couldn't tolerate anticoagulation and therefore weren't
candidates for thrombolysis.

So you're in a patient where the leg is $$00:46:00$$ threatened. You
can't anticoagulate them, you can't thrombolize them. And then what do
you do well in that case? \~\~Well, ~~then potentially thrombectomy may
have a role~~ , um, \~\~as a sort of last ditch approach. But in that
sort of, if that's not the case, then almost always a catheter based
approach is less invasive ~~it's.~~

\~\~Um, \~\~it's more acceptable. \~\~Um, ~~also it's people who've got
more training. I~~ I mean, \~\~open thrombectomy is it would be very
interesting \~\~for, \~\~for trainees to read some of the descriptions
of open thrombectomy. \~\~I mean, it's a, ~~it's a very satisfying
technique, but it's quite involved. It involves~~ , uh,\~\~ finding and
exposing the femoral Refunder and superficial femoral veins.

It's, \~\~you know, ~~prying tight compression around the lower leg to
milk the clots out~~ , um, \~\~from this deletes approximately. So the
original descriptions are really interesting. \~\~Um, \~\~but really
very rarely would we need to do that.

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* so you've mentioned catheter
directed techniques for clot burden reduction. There's been a lot of\~\~
, uh,\~\~ trials recently, which have challenged our thinking on the
appropriateness of these techniques, such as the attract and the coven
trial. What's your take on the current evidence?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** \~\~Um, \~\~ controversial. ~~Um, so, so~~ the
fundamental issue here $$00:47:00$$ is that the trials that have been
done almost certainly would not have included a large number of people
who would benefit from interventions in the opinion of the
investigators. So if somebody has got severe DVT, it is unlikely,
particularly in the U S where the attract trial was done, but these
people would have been randomized into the trial.

So the immediate criticism of the trials is that this is not reflective
of the population. Know, you've excluded the people that benefit. So
it's an underestimate of the benefit of the technique. \~\~Um, ~~but it
really that the trial results themselves~~ , um, \~\~there is a modest
benefits. \~\~Um, \~\~so in the Kavanaugh trial, ~~the quality of life ,
um, and the PTs rate that was actually~~ the PTs rate was reduced.

\~\~Um, \~\~the quality of life was less impressive, but the PTs rate
was reduced moderately. And in the attract trial, when they subgroup
analyzed the only femoral DBT group, then there was \~\~a, \~\~a
reduction in the number of people who develop moderate and severe PTs.
\~\~Um, \~\~so I think the numbers are something along the lines of
you'd have to treat 10 people with thrombus removal to $$00:48:00$$
prevent one person developing moderate to severe PTs.

So then the discussion is\~\~ , well, \~\~are those numbers needed to
treat appropriate for intervention? \~\~Um, ~~Particularly when you then
start to consider the additional need for stenting surveillance, et
cetera. So I think the jury is very much out~~ , um,\~\~ and \~\~you've
got it's, ~~it's turning into a~~ , uh,\~\~ a Brexit or a Donald Trump
like discussion.

You've got, \~\~you know, \~\~really stark, strong, firmly held
unshiftable views on both sides of the argument. \~\~Uh, \~\~and what we
need is a bit of nuance. What we need \~\~is, \~\~is everyone accepts
that some people benefit let's all work together, try and work out,
which people benefit that's work on case selection. ~~Um,~~

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** So we'll put you on the spot then. \~\~Um,
\~\~when \~\~would you offer, \~\~would you offer thrombolysis which
patients would you offer it in and which circumstances would you also
stent?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** so ~~we,~~ we have them thrombolysis \~\~um,
\~\~we've got a pretty big deeply in this practice. \~\~Um, ~~but.
Pretty reluctant use of thrombolize is~~ is everybody gets if somebody
is being considered for trombone. Well, \~\~ first of all, there's no
role for thrombolysis in anything other than only a femoral segment. So
if it's inferring when or DVT, but it's approximately even for the
$$00:49:00$$ legacy severely symptomatic, but studies have showed that
actually you cause harm by attempting early thrombus removal is that's
the first important point.

Even if they have got severe symptoms, there's always a role for
conservative management, compression elevation. And a lot of these
people have a dramatic improvement in their symptoms. \~\~Um, \~\~if
they don't and there's an honest discussion ~~then potentially,~~ and
the bleeding risk is low\~\~ , um,\~\~ then potentially there is a role,
but when there's a treatment with a borderline benefit or the benefit is
unclear, then I think what we've gotta do pick low risk patients.

So low bleeding risk, we've got to choose teams and techniques with the
highest risk of technical success. And we've got to pick people where we
think the benefit is greatest. I, those that have the highest risk of
PTs, so \~\~that \~\~those are \~\~sort of \~\~questions. ~~I think~~
you've got to ask yourself is living with slow.

Have they got a high risk of PTSD, but didn't do anything. And can I do
the technique with a high level of technical success? If they answer
those questions are appropriate, then that's the time to proceed whether
or not you $$00:50:00$$ stent is \~\~very, \~\~very difficult. ~~Um, so
we,~~ we had a case not so long ago where we had a very nice result from
early thrombus removal.

We stented, and the patients from Bose again early and subsequently was
identified to have triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome. And
obviously there wasn't the opportunity in the time to make that
diagnosis prior to the decisions around the thrombus removal. So you end
up stung and now this patient has a stent can be very difficult to open
up again.

\~\~Um, \~\~so \~\~the, \~\~the advocates and the aggressive centers
would say, you can't leave a. \~\~Uh, ~~significant stenosis after
thrombus removal, otherwise away from Bose. Whereas others will say~~ ,
well,\~\~ hang on. If we go back to the early studies, like Kevin's
\~\~very, \~\~very few. If any people actually had stents, but actually
their results were still reasonable.

\~\~So, you know, ~~it's difficult. I think once you get on the roller
coaster of thrombus removal, it's very difficult not to then proceed
also to stenting. If you see a significant lesion, for example, at the
mater and appoint~~ , um,\~\~ final comments I make is that the use of
recanalization and stenting for chronic PTs is a very effective
$$00:51:00$$ technique.

And so another approach, if you're not sure is to manage them
conservatively, but always have that up your sleeve\~\~ , um,\~\~ that
if they get significant PTs at six months, no earlier then we could
potentially consider recapitalizing and stenting at that point.

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** ~~and then does he think we should just go
back quickly? We jumped question 21. Um, just to talk. Yeah. Do you want
to, do you want to just ask that one? I think it'll be quite nice
introduction to that animal section.~~

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* ~~I'll just skip to asking about
PTs. Maybe that might be a better thing to do, do you think?~~

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** ~~Uh, can I get, I I mean, we can edit it
around. Call me so.~~

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* \~\~Yeah, of course. Um, so w \~\~

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** \~\~Well, we'll skip back a part, sort of
go back to where we were. Um, we were talking about the license. So, um,
\~\~following from the lysis, what duration of anticoagulation is
required?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** ~~So, so~~ the whole point of anticoagulation
after DVT is to reduce the risk of propagation and pulmonary embolus,
firstly, but also then to reduce the risk of recurrent VTE. So those are
the two main names of anticoagulating people. \~\~Um, \~\~and the aims
don't really change if you thrombolyzed or if you put a stent in
~~now.~~

~~So it was~~ some people used to say, Oh, I put a stent in we've
treated the Maita. No, that was the main cause of DVT. So we can stop
the anticoagulation \~\~that \~\~that's not the case. So it shouldn't
change it \~\~shouldn't \~\~certainly shouldn't be any shorter if you've
thrombolize and put a stent in. Now, whether it should be longer because
you put a stent in that's debatable.

Some $$00:52:00$$ people have very aggressive anticoagulation protocols
after stenting, but that's to do with the stent rather than the DVT.
\~\~Um, \~\~so I'm not sure if that sounds a new question, but I think
remember the aims, which are to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and PE.
And to stop propagation of the current event.

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* ~~so~~ some patients may present
with very profound, lower limb swelling. Pain and cyanosis with a threat
to viability of the limb. Can you explain for us what flag Misa is and
an approach to treatment?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** ~~So, um, so like maize, you,~~ there's two
sorts of like Macy that are\~\~ , uh,\~\~ described. \~\~Um, \~\~and to
be honest, ~~I think,~~ I don't think anybody has a\~\~ , uh,\~\~ a
detailed and robust understanding of what these actually mean. \~\~So
\~\~, but maybe say Alberto lens. So Alba is \~\~the, \~\~the white leg.
Karelia is the severe. Form a flag measure.

\~\~mean, \~\~theoretically, it's got a limb loss rate of 30 or 40%
severe limb threat compartment, syndrome, skin, blistering, swelling, et
cetera. \~\~Um, \~\~the reality is that \~\~it's, \~\~it's often
overdiagnosed, so you'll see a lot of people saying I did being
assembled licensed $$00:53:00$$ for flatmates you, and it's just a big
swollen in Gorge leg.

The reason it happens is almost certainly a profound obstruction of
venous outflow. So the venous blood in the leg cannot escape. You get
\~\~this, ~~this cycle of worsening pressure~~ , uh,\~\~ leaking ~~of ,
uh,~~ of fluid from the Capella is increasing pressure, increased
specialist, soft tissues. And then that starts to threaten tissue
perfusion and potentially if it's bad enough that cappelary even the
arterial pressure will, the competitor is threatened the actual arterial
profusion of the leg as well.

So that's the sort of most severe and extreme form. \~\~Um, \~\~I don't
think anybody has confidently linked. The anatomical findings and
features of a DVT to what the leg looks like. \~\~Um, ~~I've never been
never ceased to amaze me. There was a patient I saw who literally had~~
, um,\~\~ a thrombose \~\~um, \~\~every deep vein thrombosis from the
IVC down to both lower legs and was almost asymptomatic or Q3 was almost
asymptomatic.

\~\~So, \~\~so we've got this very uncomfortable lack of understanding
between the $$00:54:00$$ symptoms and the clinical and anatomical
pattern of DDT.

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** ~~right. So shall we move on? We've got a
few more questions to talk about. Um, uh, approximate, deep venous
insufficiency. Um, what have we got here? Sort of five or six questions,
and then we can probably wrap things up to a close then identify what
your feeling is if you have time.~~

**manj_gohel - denoise:** ~~Carry on, carry on guys.~~

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** ~~Um, brilliant.~~ So finally, let's move
on to talk about the treatment of proximal deep venous insufficiency.

\~\~Um, \~\~and when we talk about that, we're talking about obstruction
\~\~and, \~\~and competence. What are the common causes for deep venous
obstruction? Thinking about \~\~sort of \~\~post-thrombotic and
non-thrombotic obstructions.

**manj_gohel - denoise:** \~\~ \~\~ so again, the terminology is
important. So it's venous outflow obstruction. \~\~Um, ~~obstruction
implies that there's a physiological barrier causing the consequences as
opposed to occlusion, which is an anatomical term. So term is Venus
outflow obstruction, and essentially anything that reduces the ability
of~~ , um,\~\~ venous blood to escape the leg via deep venous channels
will cause an obstruction.

And again, going back to a bit of physiology. So I always forget, I
think it's Percy's law that talks about the flow rates being the fourth
power of the radius. \~\~Um, \~\~so it's really interesting. Yeah, a
question to ask is if you've got a two centimeter vein, $$00:55:00$$ how
many, one centimeter veins would it take to carry the same potential
flow as a one, two centimeter beam?

And the long story short is that it takes 16 one centimeter veins to
carry the same amounts of potential flow as one, two centimeter vein. So
it doesn't take much of a narrowing to have a great potential impact on
flow. And of course, most of the time you don't need that flow
potential. \~\~You know, \~\~it's only an absolute extremes \~\~of,
\~\~of circulatory stress that you'll need that sort of potential, but
\~\~it, it, \~\~it is interesting.

And again, it also challenges when people say, Oh, there's great
collaterals. \~\~That \~\~that'll be enough. \~\~Well \~\~we'll know,
unless they're enormous, \~\~you know, \~\~you need 16 of them \~\~to,
\~\~to have the same potential. \~\~Uh, \~\~blood carrying capacity.
\~\~Um, \~\~so in terms of the causes, \~\~I mean, \~\~lots and lots of
goals, the most common by far is post-thrombotic disease.

So when you've had a DVT, one of three things happens. If you're lucky,
the vein will recanalize completely, if you're unlucky, it will obstruct
completely. And if you're somewhere in between, you'll end up
$$00:56:00$$ with partial stenosis and obstruction. \~\~And, \~\~and
what's important is even if the vein is open, what you almost always
lose in the post-thrombotic vein is a lack of compliance.

Isn't, \~\~you know, \~\~it's not the same compliant vein that can
respond to demands and physiological need that you have, which \~\~in a,
~~a, in a primary non~~ , uh,\~\~ scarred vein\~\~ , um,\~\~ other
potential causes are. So this idea of a non-thrombotic early at vein
lesion, or may turn a lesion. So may turn again, the original paper,
1953 is very interesting reading.

\~\~Um, ~~there were a couple of Austrian~~ , um, ~~pathologists who
were looking at kind of various specimens and they identified that a
very high proportion of people, particularly those had left-sided DVT
hard, not only the~~ , uh,\~\~ overriding iliac artery causing
compression, but they had a secondary fibrosis tight fibrosis in the
iliac vein.

So it's not just the compression. It's not just the fact that it's
squashed because any one of us in a certain position we'll have a
squashed vein. It's the fact that there's a $$00:57:00$$ secondary
inflammatory fibrotic change, which is what's causing the obstruction.
So that's a true may turn or non from what's it lesion.

\~\~Um, ~~and the other big group of patients of course, is malignant~~
, um, \~\~lymph node or retroperitoneal fibrosis related venous outflow
obstruction, but post-thrombotic by far was the most communist diagnosis
mythology.

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** \~\~I thought you got to put me on the
spot though and asked me a very difficult maths question. So I'm
slightly relieved about that. Um, and, ~~and outpatient clinic~~ ,
we,\~\~ we may see patients who come in with\~\~ , um,\~\~ severe venous
disease. \~\~So, you know, \~\~coming in with finished skin changes, for
example, when would you consider actually imaging the ~~deep , um,~~
approximately deep veins in addition to superficial and deep veins in
the leg and what are the best modalities to do this?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** \~\~um, \~\~so it really getting down \~\~to
the, \~\~to the sort of crutch of \~\~the, \~\~the importance of a
detailed assessment of the entire supervision deep system. \~\~So, so
\~\~every patient with venous disease should have a whole leg inferring
when or duplex to start with. So that's deep and superficial veins. So
there's no real role for just looking at superficial veins.

So you $$00:58:00$$ need to understand the context in terms of their
structure they're and if they're refluxing to understand the context\~\~
, um,\~\~ and again, remember that. Reflux on a duplex. Yes. All we see
is arrows going in certain directions, but all reflux means is that
after a car fork, mentation maneuver, there is some retrograde flow in a
superficial vein, more than half a second in a deep vein, more than one
second.

That's all it means. So for example, you can have retrograde flow for
0.6 seconds in a saphenous vein, and that will be labeled, defined as
reflux for all the rest of the time that superficial vein is doing the
right job, it's returning the blood to the heart. So just \~\~be, \~\~be
wary of interpreting what these arrows mean.

\~\~Um, \~\~and in terms of how that affects your decision-making. First
of all, one approach is to consider the overall burden of venous
disease. And these people are being as hypertension. And what I try and
do is draw a pie charts and say, you got to be this hypertension. You've
got venous disease, and here are the different causes of your venous
disease.

And $$00:59:00$$ that might include superficial reflux, deep venous
reflux, deep into the obstruction, other factors. And you \~\~sort of
\~\~try and, \~\~you know, \~\~apply \~\~some, \~\~some clinical
judgment as to what the different factors are. Now. Even if they've got
significant, deep venous reflux and superficial venous reflux, there is
still a role for treating superficial reflux.

In most of these cases, I still come across colleagues and other people
who say, look, you shouldn't treat the superficial veins if there's the
reflux. \~\~Um, \~\~but all the studies ever Escar have shown
significant benefits, even if there's equally flux. \~\~So, \~\~so
again, key message is treat the superficial reflux.

If it's there now, venous obstruction and looking for it is a different
matter. \~\~Um, ~~there are~~ , um,\~\~ again, lots of approaches or
some people are very aggressive about evaluating the iliac veins.
\~\~Um, You know, \~\~CTVs on everybody Iverson. The problem is if you
get super aggressive, then you start to over-diagnose and if you start
to over-diagnose, you start to over treat and this all gets very messy.

\~\~Um, um, ~~I think the sort of people~~ $$01:00:00$$ that have got
clear signs and symptoms of major venous outflow obstruction,
particularly things like being a school education history of previous
DVT, really disproportionate Venus changes to the superficial and the
inferring mineral imaging. Those are the people that image , um,\~\~ and
~~on the soup~~ on the duplex imaging of the leg, if there are changes
in the common femoral vein that make you think there's a proximal
problem, particularly a loss of faces, city of flow\~\~ , um,\~\~ then
that's pretty\~\~ , uh,\~\~ concerning for a significant venous outflow
problem.

\~\~Um, \~\~so again, the face the city, \~\~I mean, \~\~there should be
in an unobstructed venous system. The common femoral vein should really
reflect the right hearts. Which has some faces city. So there should be
\~\~some, \~\~some transmission of that basis, city and respiratory
phases, city. \~\~Um, \~\~so if that isn't there, then you're thinking,
hang on.

There's something interrupting that transmission, which is almost always
an obstruction somewhere. So those are the people \~\~I'd \~\~I'd image,
but I wouldn't over image. \~\~Um, \~\~because then you end up with a
headache and a problem. Should I treat you to not treat?

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** ~~Go down the rabbit hole.~~

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* \~\~so, so you, ~~so you mentioned
IVIS~~ , uh,\~\~ what is $$01:01:00$$ intravascular ultrasound and what
are the particular benefits of using this technique over save, you know,
graphy alone.

**manj_gohel - denoise:** Diverse is a, B mode only intra venous or
intravascular\~\~ , um, ~~ultrasound modality. So it's an approximately
nine French probe that is inserted into the vein. And it gives you a
three 60 degree view in bimodal. Lisa, not color flow, just B mode. Of
the~~ , uh,\~\~ anatomical structures. \~\~Um, \~\~and \~\~what it,
\~\~what it's \~\~very, ~~very useful for is identifying venous anatomy,
confluences~~ , um,\~\~ identifying the size of veins.

So it allows you to plan sizes of stents. \~\~Um, \~\~and it really is
an important adjunct to be no gruffy in other modalities. \~\~Um, \~\~so
again, we did our first 30 or so cases of deep venous stenting without
IVUS and thought we were brilliant and IVUS was a waste of money. And
then we started using over some thought preliminary.

I can't believe we were doing this without. It's \~\~like,
\~\~$$01:02:00$$ satnav, \~\~you know, \~\~once you start using it, you
suddenly realize that there, \~\~you know, it's, \~\~it's a really
useful items. \~\~Um, ~~so in terms of when you use it~~ , very,\~\~
very rarely per diagnostic. So it's not really used for diagnostic,
although in some parts of the world it's commonly used for diagnostic
because the risk of over-diagnosis.

But \~\~very, \~\~very commonly, almost routinely for therapeutic,
particularly when we're stenting the veins to plan our landing zones.

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** \~\~I mean, you, \~\~you talked about
over-diagnosis. Can you talk us through some of the decision-making
processes that you go through when you're assessing a patient who has a
deep venous obstruction?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** there are lots of patients that have this
anatomical change. \~\~So \~\~the number of referrals I get from people
who have done a CT and they've picked up a problem. \~\~So \~\~the most
important thing is the clinical status and the clinical picture. \~\~So
\~\~have they got symptoms go about right at the beginning of the
podcast?

Have they got symptoms? Have they got complications? And if they haven't
got significant symptoms and they haven't got significant complications
and there's not really an indication for treatments. \~\~Um, ~~so leg
swelling~~ , um,\~\~ $$01:03:00$$ was. Initially frequently pushed as a
Oh you're swelling will get better if we get rid of your obstruction.

That's only the case in probably less than 50% of cases. \~\~Um, ~~and
the reason for that is that when you, yes, the original etiology for the
swelling may well have been Venus, but you almost always get a secondary
lymphatic disfunction when you've had swelling. For whatever reason,
whether it's heart failure, whether it's Venus~~ , the, \~\~the
lymphatic system gets damaged.

And so even if you get rid of the original\~\~ , uh,\~\~ cause the
lymphatic damage persists, of course, and the swelling persists. \~\~So,
um, ~~the symptoms are very important. And~~ , uh,\~\~ in terms of
complications, \~\~I mean, you know, \~\~if somebody obviously got
intractable ulceration, et cetera, these are all important became
patients, but a bit of skin change a bit of, \~\~you know, \~\~mild
swelling, you know, careful case selection is very important for these
procedures.

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* so following a deep venous
recanalization and standing, what surveillance do you offer for those
patients?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** surveillance has been evolving. \~\~Um, so
the, ~~the first~~ $$01:04:00$$ availability for , um,\~\~ CE marks DB
in the States in the UK was around 2012. \~\~Um, \~\~and ~~so~~ the
\~\~service \~\~services across the country really got started at a few
centers in 2012, 2013. \~\~Um, \~\~initially there was an early scan and
then a scan maybe at six weeks and, \~\~you know, \~\~three or six
months down the line.

I think we realized that in general, the people that developed problems,
often development very early. So we are scanning these people the day
after the intervention. Obviously there's interoperative quality control
and venograms and scanning, but the day after the intervention to ensure
that there's no early thrombus\~\~ , uh,\~\~ problems.

And then a couple of weeks to make sure that there's nothing that's
happened in the first couple of weeks, because there's an opportunity to
re intervene to, to balloon, to correct any technical issues. At that
point, after that point, it's usually six weeks, three months, six
months, and then annually thereafter.

So that's a sort of protocol that we have. \~\~Um, \~\~and in general,
what we've seen is that people that develop problems tend to develop
them relatively early. So once you get to a year, then in general, the
$$01:05:00$$ patency rates are \~\~very, \~\~very good. ~~And, and as,
as you , um, as you know them in doing our,~~ in our center, that the
chronic PTs stenting\~\~ , um, PA\~\~ primary patency rates at around
three years are over 80%, 80, 85% is what you can expect in these
patients.

Of course, there are some that have problems, but it's important to,
~~again, to~~ remember that even those that have thrombosed, they
generally go back to the level of symptoms they have prior to
intervention. That's very reassuring. The last thing you want to do is
to make people worse \~\~with a, \~\~with a novel intervention.

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* And so what about your
anti-coagulation and anti-platelet regime for these patients?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** \~\~so, um, \~\~ there was a systematic review
done a few years ago where all of the published literature for deep
venous stenting was reviewed. And I think the authors identified 28
different regimens for anticoagulation of the stenting. \~\~Um, so, um,
\~\~the honest answer is nobody knows. \~\~Um, ~~our approach is to~~ ,
um,\~\~ to have low molecular weight heparin as the primary
anticoagulant for the initial two week period. And then at the two week
point, they undergo a stent. If there's no issues, they $$01:06:00$$ get
transitioned to a DELAC. In addition, the patients get six weeks of
clopidogrel as an anti-platelets. \~\~Um, ~~and again, the reason for
that is that~~ , um,\~\~ it's a foreign material into the vein. Yes. The
role of anti-platelets of renting venous thrombosis is very limited.

But there has to be some platelet related activity and platelet
activation involved there. So it \~\~sort of \~\~makes logical sense to
have some anti-platelet activity. \~\~Um, \~\~of course the downside is
that there's an increasing bleeding risk. So this is the sort of, these
are the constant tightropes that you're walking with these patients.

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** \~\~and finding the, we \~\~we've talked
about endovascular and Venus treatments, but is there a role for open
surgery in these patients?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** \~\~Um, \~\~so in the IDX segment, very
rarely. \~\~Um, \~\~so in some patients, yes, you can do PTFE,
reconstructions and bypasses. And of course the traditional operations
of Parmadale bypass and the may who's in the type procedures. \~\~I
mean, they all, \~\~they all sounded very elegant in the books, but the
reality is a great sadness vein $$01:07:00$$ going across the lower
abdomen to the other side.

\~\~Um, ~~is not really going to sort the problem out in an enjoyable
way~~ , uh, \~\~for all sorts of obvious reasons, the size of the vein,
the pressure and all that sort of stuff. So there's really very limited
role for those sorts of procedures. Now, the one area where there may be
a role for open reconstruction is in the common femoral vein.

~~Um, so the, the consists,~~ the consistent observation is that good
inflow is absolutely imperative to get good outcomes in these patients.
And sometimes if the common femoral vein has got a lot of scarring, then
it's very difficult \~\~to, \~\~to be able to reconstruct that inflow
endovascularly. \~\~Um, ~~and so a number of authors have advocated the
use of, and the phlebectomy~~ , um,\~\~ opening up the common femoral
vein\~\~ , uh,\~\~ cutting out the scarring and the tribulations,
putting a patch on it.

Sometimes even putting an AB fistula little six millimeter graph from
the comment from an artery onto the vein to really drive the flow
through the stent. \~\~Um, \~\~it's a pretty complicated operation and
you imagine \~\~you're, \~\~you're dissecting down. There's lots of
little veins everywhere else. And lymphatics the $$01:08:00$$
complication, the wound complication rate is \~\~very, \~\~very high.

So really very limited role only. \~\~Um, \~\~the endovascular is really
the way forward for these patients ~~speaking.~~

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* \~\~so finally, let's talk about
pelvic confess. Sorry, start again. Okay. Um, so, um, \~\~ so finally,
let's talk about pelvic congestion syndrome. What is pelvic congestion
syndrome and how does it present?

**manj_gohel - denoise:** \~\~Um, so \~\~it often doesn't present
anywhere near a vascular surgeon. \~\~Um, ~~so there are a number of~~ ,
um,\~\~ of ladies who present with these chronic heaviness and dragging
symptoms in the lower abdomen. There may be some \~\~association with
\~\~association with men, seas there's often dyspareunia and a whole
variety of other symptoms.

There may be associated\~\~ , um,\~\~ Volvo viruses or Hosteria\~\~ ,
uh,\~\~ buttock and five-hour seas\~\~ , um,\~\~ all\~\~ , uh,\~\~ as a
result of pelvic venous incompetence. \~\~Um, \~\~but it's a complicated
field. \~\~Um, ~~there are some people that have pelvic symptoms.
There's some people that have the varicose veins or something, we'll
have a combination of the two~~ , um,\~\~ And almost always they will be
seen and initially assessed by the gynecology teams rather than coming
to the vascular surgeons.

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** and when we do see these patients, are
there any $$01:09:00$$ treatment options available for them? And when
would you consider treating

**manj_gohel - denoise:** \~\~Uh, \~\~ in a highly selective way. ~~Um,
so the difficulty again, so~~ this is venous disease in a nutshell, the
association between anatomical changes and clinical symptoms is ropey at
best. \~\~Um, ~~in terms of post partum~~ , um,\~\~ women, an enormous
proportion of these\~\~ , uh, \~\~ladies have got venous reflux in the
pelvis. If you look hard enough.

\~\~Um, \~\~and so the problem is if you start looking for \~\~like
\~\~may Turner syndrome, if you start looking hard enough, you start
identifying these symptoms and then you lose the. The ability to really
discern who's going to benefit most. So again, I would go back to
clinical symptoms as the single most important thing.

If they've got severe clinical symptoms\~\~ , um,\~\~ measuring,
affecting their quality of life and associated significant venous
changes and those that people are trying to intervene\~\~ , um,\~\~ it's
not necessarily a benign procedure. \~\~So, um, ~~pelvic vein
embolization~~ , um,\~\~ involves implantation of\~\~ , uh,\~\~ of
coils. \~\~Um, \~\~there's concerns about non-targeted embolization
calls have ended up in lungs.$$01:10:00$$

There are a number of people with unknown\~\~ , uh,\~\~ nickel allergies
that have problems with these coils. \~\~So, \~\~so again, it's not an
area to be over aggressive. \~\~Um, \~\~and so careful case selection is
important. ~~Um, so there, there are, there are a number of , um,~~ so
again, a quick plug for the ESPs guidelines to the ~~Venus , uh,~~
chronic venous disease guidelines that are currently being rewritten,
and there'll be published towards the end of this year.

I think early next year. And there's a \~\~very, \~\~very good section
on pelvic venous disease assessment. What's very important is again, to
differentiate pelvic venous, pelvic congestion syndrome, to pelvic
origin, very costly. And one thing that is certainly being advocated as
\~\~if, if the, \~\~if the varicose veins are coming from the pelvis,
but there's no pelvic congestion syndrome, it's perfectly reasonable
just to deal with the visible varicosities from below with some foam
sclerotherapy or other treatment from below, rather than being super
aggressive embolizing from above.

\~\~Um, ~~but I think anybody who's involved in managing this really
needs to work closely with the gynecologists that are going to college,
a diagnosis that need~~ $$01:11:00$$ excluding probably before we start
to address the venous disease. And there are a number of , um,\~\~
validated questionnaires and other assessment tools that are probably
quite important.

\~\~Um, \~\~so not for the faint-hearted.

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** ~~indeed. I mean, did you have any other
questions?~~

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* ~~now, Mr. Gold, is there anything
else you think we should discuss~~

\~\~or you think we've got \~\~

**manj_gohel - denoise:** ~~maybe, maybe one quick thing about training
and the future role of Venus. Um, there's been a sub-specialty in for
vascular trainees and vascular future. So that might be quite a good
middle question. So what do you think of something along those lines?
Um, I'm slightly biased and very passionate, but I think it's
important.~~

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* ~~Andrew, what do you think? You
want me to rephrase the question?~~

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** ~~Yeah, I I mean, for me on the spot now ,
um,~~

\~\~what should I say , um, regards to Mr. Gold with regards to , uh,
trading, or should I , uh, don't want my patient doing things on the
spot. Um, ~~Do you think there is a role for particular subspecialty
training in venous disease~~ , um,\~\~ and particular fellowships for
trainees to take.

**manj_gohel - denoise:** I think it's a really important question,
~~Andrew. So, um, so~~ venous disease and Venus\~\~ , uh,\~\~
interventions have definitely been the Cinderella part of vascular
surgery \~\~for, \~\~for a \~\~long, \~\~long time. \~\~Um, you know,
\~\~and, \~\~you know, \~\~you could say quite rightly the focus has
been on getting technical skills in arterial disease and aneurism
surgery, et cetera, \~\~that \~\~that's all fine and important, but
there are \~\~many, many, \~\~many more patients with venous disease.

The role of vascular interventions for these patients has become clearer
than ever. \~\~Um, ~~the societal benefits, the cost benefits~~ , um,
\~\~the patient benefits are absolutely enormous. So I think it's
important that \~\~we \~\~we're almost sending the best people to be
managing these $$01:12:00$$ patients. So it's important that we grasp
the nettle and accept that.

But, \~\~you know, ~~we really need to take leadership roles in, in~~ ,
uh,\~\~ managing venous disease\~\~ , um, \~\~in terms of specific
training. \~\~Um, ~~I think it's important for people to gain as much
training during that training period as possible, but of course, augment
that with~~ , um,\~\~ with some more focus training, post CCT, if
needed.

\~\~Um, ~~I don't think everyone needs to be an expert in deep venous
stenting or complex interventions, but certainly~~ , um, ~~local
champions are needed to try and push this disease process forward and~~
, uh,\~\~ and to help this patient group\~\~ , um,\~\~ it's low hanging
fruits and \~\~it's, \~\~it's definitely something ~~we are best
managed.~~

We're best placed to manage.

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** ~~Hmm. And I suppose a follow-up question
to that as we could talk about , um, is,~~ do you think that there is a
role for centralizing some of\~\~ , um,\~\~ more complex, deep
venous\~\~ , um, \~\~procedures? \~\~Not, \~\~not just \~\~sort of
\~\~deep venous stenting, but \~\~uh, \~\~venous thrombosis and DVT.

**manj_gohel - denoise:** \~\~Um, there's, \~\~there's always this
balance between having treatments available to as much of the population
as possible versus having that volume outcome safety association. And
the honest answer is of $$01:13:00$$ course, there's some sort of
sensible middle ground. We need more than two or three centers in the
country doing it, but we don't need every center doing it.

So I think the centers that are interested and there are plenty need to
have the local governance structures and local networks in place.
\~\~And, ~~and some sensible centralization of course is going to be~~ ,
um,\~\~ probably the way forward.

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** Mr. Gold\~\~ , we've,\~\~ we've covered an
awful lot\~\~ , um,\~\~ in these podcasts. Thank you ever so much for
your time. \~\~Um, \~\~and equip plug, as you said, for the venous
thrombosis guidelines, which can be found on the European journal of
vascular surgery website.

\*\*aminder-2021-4-18\_\_17-8-43:\*\* It's been a real pleasure Mr.
Goldhill, having you on the podcast and we really appreciate your time.

**andrew_nickinson-denoise:** Thank you

Have a second.

**manj_gohel - denoise:** Thank you very much, guys. \~\~It's \~\~it's
been enjoyable. Thank you.
