Management of Dialysis access is an important topic of discussion, not
only because it is a significant part of board examinations, but also
because healthcare costs continue to rise for ESRD patients,
particularly during the transition from CKD to ESRD. This is attributed
to use of dialysis catheters and frequent hospitalizations for
arteriovenous access failures and related procedures.

The National Kidney Foundation-Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative
(NKF-KDOQI) and SVS has provided guidelines in the follow areas:

-   Timing of referral to access surgeons

-   Operative strategies to maximize placement of autogenous AV accesses

-   First choice for autogenous access

-   Choice of AV access when a patient is not a suitable candidate for a
    forearm autogenous access

-   The role of monitoring and surveillance of AV access management

-   Conversion of a prosthetic AV access to a secondary autogenous AV
    access

-   Management of nonfunctional or failed AV access

**This brings us to the question, who needs dialysis access?**

Patients should be referred to a vascular surgeon for access when their
creatinine clearance is \<25mL/min which is CKD stage 4. You want to
provide adequate time for your autogenous access to mature, so the ideal
time for access creation would be \> 6 months for anticipated need of
dialysis. This allows for time for any subsequent interventions if your
access is not maturing.

**Should prosthetic access also be placed several months before
anticipated dialysis?**

Prosthetic access patency is limited by duration of access placement,
thus, if a patient requires prosthetic access, placement should be
delayed until about 3-6 weeks before initiation of dialysis

**For dialysis access creation, which site should be considered and used
first?**

Due to the easier accessibility and lower infection rates, upper
extremity access sites are used first. Furthermore, you want to place
your access as far distally in the extremity as possible to preserve the
proximal arm for future accesses.

**What are some important considerations in a patient's history when
planning a dialysis access?**

It is important to find out recent history of peripheral IV lines, sites
of any indwelling catheters including pacemakers and defibrillators, as
well as placement of previous catheters. Any previous access procedures
should be identified. In additions, any history of trauma or surgery to
the upper extremities is important to identify. Moreover, you also want
to consider the patient's quality of life, thus, noting which extremity
is dominant is important. If possible, you want to create your dialysis
access in the nondominant arm so that when the patient is receiving
dialysis multiple times a week, they are able to use their dominant arm
during their dialysis sessions

**As with any preoperative planning, physical examination is extremely
important. Central venous stenosis can cause problems such as prolonged
bleeding after dialysis sessions at the puncture site. What are some
signs of central venous stenosis?**

Unilateral arm swelling or edema and prominent venous collaterals are
signs of central venous stenosis. Central venous stenosis can lead to
venous hypertension which affects access patency and function, and also
causes disabling edema.  Beyond signs of central venous stenosis, when
examining a patient, an Allen's test should always be performed to
evaluate palmer arch patency.

**Preoperative planning should also include arterial and venous
assessments. What are your size requirements for the artery and the vein
to be used in your dialysis access creation?**

First, you want equal pressure gradients in bilateral upper extremities
and the artery should be greater than or equal to 2mm. A venous duplex
should also be done to evaluate for diameter, distensibility and
continuity. A vein mapping is useful to determine the size of the
patient's superficial veins at various points in the forearm and upper
arm. The vein should be at least 2.5mm.

**Autogenous access should always be considered first due to higher
patency rates, lower infection rates, and longer duration of access
survival. What are the different configurations of autogenous
accesses?**

The first and best option would be direct arteriovenous anastomosis.
However, if that is not possible, then venous transposition should be
considered next follow by venous translocation. Venous transposition is
for deeper veins such as the basilic vein, which is transposed so the
vein lies just below the skin for easier access for puncture during
dialysis sessions. Transpositions are generally a 2-stage procedure in
which the direct arteriovenous anastomosis is created during the first
stage and once the vein has arterialized 4-6 weeks later, the second
stage of transposition is done when the vein is easier to mobilize.
Translocation procedures include harvesting the femoral or saphenous
vein and using it as a conduit for AV access creation in the upper
extremity.

**When can a venous transposition be done in a one stage procedure?**

When the vein is \>4mm

**It was mentioned earlier that the dialysis access should be created as
distally as possible on the extremity. What are some of the most distal
locations?**

The snuffbox fistula, which is the posterior radial branch to cephalic
direct access and Brescia-cimino-appel fistula which is the
radial-cephalic wrist direct access are two of the most distal fistulas
that can be created.

**What are your arterial and venous options in the upper extremity?**

In the forearm, you have your radial, ulnar, and brachial arteries and
cephalic and basilic veins. In the upper arm, you have your brachial or
proximal radial arteries and cephalic, basilic, brachial and axillary
veins.

**If you need to use a prosthetic graft, what would you use?**

PTFE is the most common,  they make tapered 4-7mm grafts to ensure the
size of your arterial anastomosis isn't too large to minimize chances of
steal.

**The techniques of arteriovenous fistula creation are standard. Can you
go through the techniques?**

First the vein is identified and the distal end is transected and
flushed with heparin. By flushing with the heparin, you are able to
access the caliber and extent of the vein as well as identify any side
branches

Then after distal and proximal control of your artery, a 4-6mm
arteriotomy is made. The length is limited to decrease incidence of
arterial steal. The artery is then flushed with heparin to avoid
thrombosis during the anastomosis and an anastomosis is created between
the side of the artery and the end of the vein. A 6-0 or 7-0
nonabsorbable continuous suture should be used to create the anastomosis
to avoid future dilation of the anastomosis.

**What are some other options if an access is not able to be created in
the upper extremity?**

Autogenous accesses can also be created in the lower extremity. Femoral
artery to femoral vein or saphenous vein anastomosis can be created.
Both veins have to be transposed. However, one must ensure that the ABI
is normal because limb ischemia can be a devastating consequence.
Furthermore, for morbidly obese patients, the excess pannus can hinder
access in the groin region.

Access creation in the chest wall or cervical region is also possible
with axillary artery to ipsilateral axillary vein loop access, axillary
artery to contralateral axillary or jugular vein straight access (ie
necklace access) and brachial artery to jugular vein straight access.

**For patients with central venous stenosis or occlusion, what is
another alternative upper extremity access creation?**

For these patients, the hemodialysis reliable outflow (HeRO) device can
come to the rescue. This device is composed of 2 components: a graft
which is made of 6mm PTFE with a titanium coupler at one end, and a
venous outflow component of a 19 Fr silicone catheter reinforced with a
nitinol braid to prevent kinking. The graft portion is anastomosed to an
artery, usually brachial, and is tunneled subcutaneously and the venous
component is percutaneously placed into the right atrium via the IJ or
subclavian vein. The two components are connected with a titanium
coupler at the deltopectoral groove. If you need more immediate
dialysis, the super HeRO comes to the rescue in which the graft portion
is the early cannulation graft.

**When is the newly created dialysis access ready for use?**

A good way to remember this is the rule of 6's. it's ready to use when
the Fistula is 6mm in Diameter, has a flow of 600ml/min, is 6mm from the
surface of the skin and usually takes 6 weeks to mature. Prosthetic AV
accesses can be used as early as 2 weeks postoperatively. If you use the
early cannulation grafts, the access can be used as early as 24 hours
after access creation. This is great because it offers the potential for
avoidance of dialysis catheters in patients who need dialysis
immediately.

**What are some reasons why an access may fail to mature?**

Sometimes your access may have arterial inflow stenosis. This is
difficult to detect clinically because there will be a palpable thrill,
however, due to the stenosis, the flow is not sufficient enough for
dialysis. In the absence of arterial inflow issues, collateral or large
venous branches can divert blood away from the main access channel
resulting in insufficient flow.

**If the newly created AV fistula is not maturing, what are some
secondary procedures to help with maturation?**

Open procedures include vein patches, interposition vein grafts, vein
transposition to proximal arteries, branch ligations, and vein
superficialization. Endovascular procedures include arterial and venous
angioplasties.

**Once a dialysis access is created, maintenance of the access is
extremely important. The flow disturbances and hemodynamic changes
associated with AV access creation causes intimal hyperplasia leading to
venous outflow stenosis. This can ultimately lead to access thrombosis
and failure. What are some methods of detecting access failure?**

One way of detecting a well functioning access is a strong thrill at the
arterial anastomosis which continues a few centimeters into the outflow
vein. If you feel a pulsation near the venous outflow, then a stenosis
or thrombosis is likely. If you feel a thrill distal to the area of
pulsation, then you have likely localized your area of stenosis. It is
important to note that you may feel a pulsation at a pseudoaneurysm
independent of venous outflow issues.

Another way to detect stenosis is collateral veins or upper extremity
edema. This is indicative of venous hypertension likely secondary to
stenosis. You will typically see this in the shoulder area or anterior
chest as a results of subclavian vein stenosis/thrombosis. Moreover,
these high venous pressures as a result of the stenosis can result in
excessive and prolonged bleeding after removal of needles from the
dialysis puncture sites. This is often the first sign of elevated venous
pressures.

**What are some endovascular interventions for a failing access?**

The most common intervention is a simple balloon angioplasty of the
stenosed area. Insufflation times are generally up to 2-3 minutes.
Treatment of stenosis 2/2 intimal hyperplasia often require high
pressures of 20atm or more. However, this is a double edge sword because
this can lead to trauma in the veins stimulating a further intimal
hyperplasia process. Some advocate a cutting balloon before high
pressure dilation. Stenting is also an option to treat residual stenosis
or dissections after balloon angioplasty. Covered stents have shown good
patency results.

**If endovascular interventions fail, what are some open options for
managing a failing access?**

Generally an interposition graft or patch angioplasty is performed and
the results of the two techniques are largely equivalent.

**If an AV access has ultimately failed and thrombosed, what are your
endovascular options at this point?**

Some endovascular options are catheter directed thrombolysis with about
2-4mg of tPA injected into the clot, followed by balloon angioplasty
(typically an 8mm by 8cm high pressure balloon). A mechanical
thrombectomy device, such as angiojet, can also be used in combination
to thrombolysis.

**Alternatively, an open thrombectomy with a thromboembolectomy balloon
and patch angioplasty of venous stenosis areas can also be used.
Moreover, a hybrid approach of open thrombectomy with percutaneous
interventions of venous stenosis areas has been described.**

**Earlier, you mentioned steal syndrome, can you explain to us what this
is?**

Steal syndrome is also known as Access Related Hand Ischemis = ARHI. It
is an uncommon but devastating complication of access creation. All
patients with arteriovenous fistulas have some degree of physiologic
steal or reversal of flow in part of the artery distal to the fistula.
However, this is not sufficient enough to cause ischemia. Rather,
ischemia results from inadequate collateral circulation and inability of
peripheral arteries to meet the increased demand. Diseased vessels do
not dilate and stenosis of arteries leads to decreased distal perfusion
pressure. Furthermore, hypotension during dialysis further decreases
perfusion causing symptoms. Steal can be limb threatening and is graded
from 0 -- 3. Grade 0 is no symptoms, Grade 1 is mild ischemia with signs
of cool extremity and flow augmentation with access occlusion. Grade 2
is moderate/intermittent ischemia that is experienced only during
dialysis and patients feel claudication. Grade 3 is severe, ischemic
pain at rest with tissue loss.

**What are some symptoms and signs of Steal syndrome?**

Symptoms include coolness, parasthesias, rest pain, and weakness. Signs
of steal include cool to touch, pallor, cyanosis, delayed capillary
refill, absent pulses/signals, diminished sensation, weak grip, and in
severe cases ulceration or gangrene. If the patient shows improvement
with access compression, diagnosis is confirmed.

**When is an intervention necessary to treat steal syndrome?**

You do not need to intervene for grade 0 and 1. For grade 3 an
intervention is mandatory. The goal of treatment includes symptom
resolution and access preservation, and this is achieved by reducing
access flow and increasing distal arterial flow.

**What are your intervention options for resolving steal syndrome?**

One simple option is banding to reduce access flow. This is done by
suture plication, placement of single narrowing tie or wrap by
constrictive cuff to cause a stenosis in the AV access near the arterial
anastomosis. A minimally invasive approach is used by the MILLER banding
which uses an endoluminal 4 or 5mm balloon as a sizer and a suture is
placed around the access with the balloon inflated. This procedure
increases arterial inflow towards the hand.

Revision using distal inflow (RUDI) involves ligation of the fistula at
the arterial anastomosis and reestablishment of flow via a more distal
artery by bypass or vein translocation. This allows for decreased flow
through the access by reducing the fistula diameter and by taking inflow
form a smaller vessel. However, ultimately, the fistula is placed at
risk

Proximalizaiton of arterial inflow (PAI) involves ligation of AV
anastomosis, and the inflow is moved to a more proximal level with a
prosthetic interposition. Dialysis can be continue via the vein. The
main advantage is the native artery's continuity.

Distal revascularization-interval ligation (DRIL) is ultimately
considered the best option by many vascular surgeons due to the
excellent results shown. There is an arterial bypass created originating
proximal to the access and ending distal to the access, with ligation of
the artery distal to the anastomosis. This prevents retrograde flow from
distal vessels and allows for a low resistance pathway for arterial
supply to the hand.

Lastly for palmar arch steal syndrome from radio-cephalic av accesses,
distal radial artery ligation (DRAL) can be performed to prevent
reversal of flow in the palmar arch. However, the ulnar artery patency
needs to evaluated first.

**Steal syndrome is not the only complication of AV access creation.
What are some other nonthrombotic complications?**

Other nonthrombotic complications include pseudoaneurysms which is a
result of trauma due to repeated punctures or poor technique and true
aneurysms which is a result of hemodynamically significant stenosis.
Both can lead to cannulation difficulties, increased risk of thrombosis,
pain, bleeding and cosmetic deformities.

Prosthetic grafts can results in seroma from ultrafiltration of the
graft and most resolve without intervention.

Most interestingly, access creation can result in neuropathy. It is
important to note that over 2/3s of the patients have preexisting
peripheral neuropathy. Neuropathy is also graded from 0-3, with 0 as
asymptomatic, 1 as mild intermittent changes (pain, paresthesia,
numbness with sensory deficit), 2 as moderate persistent sensory
changes, and 3 as severe sensory changes with progressive motor loss
(motion, strength, muscle wasting). Ischemic monomelic neuropathy is
rare but occurs acutely after AV access creation. Within hours of
surgery, patients develop acute pain, weakness, or paralysis of hand and
forearm muscles with prominent sensory loss. However, the hand is warm
with palpable pulse or audible signal in distal radial and ulnar
arteries. It is important to note that pain out of proportion is what
differentiates IMN from ARHI. Treatment is access ligation or emergent
augmentation of flow.

**Since we've beaten to death arteriovenous accesses, we are ready to
focus our attention to a different type of dialysis access. We cannot
forget about dialysis catheters. What is the difference between an acute
and chronic hemodialysis catheter?**

Chronic catheters have a subcutaneous cuff at the exit site and tunneled
to the vein. This decreased infection rates and is less likely to become
dislodged. Tunneled hemodialysis catheters can be used up to 12 months.

**If catheters cause so much problems such as infection and central
venous stenosis, what would be an indication for them?**

The most common indication would be for urgent hemodialysis. But other
indications include patient who are not operative candidates due to
advanced comorbidities, or patients who are unable to have an AVF or AVG
due to anatomic feasibility.  Temporary dialysis access may also be
needed in patients who have just had a peritoneal dialysis catheter
placement or in chronic peritoneal dialysis catheter patients requiring
abdominal or inguinal surgery.

**Which site is the most ideal site for a hemodialysis catheter?**

The right internal jugular vein is preferred because it has the best
patency

**Every procedure has potential complications. What are the immediate
complications of catheter placement?**

When placed in the internal jugular veins, there is always a chance of a
pneumothorax or hemothorax. Wire embolism can occur is control of the
wire is lost during the procedure. If the guidewire is placed too far,
then there is always a chance of arrhythmia. Thus, the best place for
the wire is through the IVC. With a left internal jugular vein approach,
there is always a risk of thoracic duct laceration. If a leak is
apparent, then the catheter needs to be removed immediately and a
pressure dressing applied.
