# Vascular Lab

**06 Jan 2022**: *Alaska Pendleton, MD and Aahita Dua, MD*

```{r echo=FALSE}

embed_audio("https://traffic.libsyn.com/audiblebleeding/E7_-_Carotid_VSITE.mp3")

```

So let's start with an overview of ultrasound modalities, waveforms, and
changes proximal and distal to flow-limiting stenosis:

## **Overview**

**Brief overview of ultrasound:** Ultrasonography uses [sound
waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_wave) with [frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) higher
than those audible to humans. Ultrasound images are created by sending
pulses of ultrasound
into [tissue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)) using
a [probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound_transducer#Use_in_medicine).
Reflected pulses are recorded and displayed as an image. There are many
types of ultrasound images, but two modes commonly seen in vascular
ultrasonography are B-mode and doppler:

**B-mode (Brightness) imaging** is a 2-D, black and white display of
tissue [acoustic
impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_impedance)s.

**Doppler mode** uses the Doppler effect to measure and visualize blood
flow.

**Spectral Doppler** converts frequency shifts from moving blood to
velocities using the Doppler equation, and displays a "spectrum" of
these frequencies as Doppler waveforms.

**Color Doppler** presents velocity information as a color-coded overlay
on top of a B-mode image. Duplex ultrasonography is a term commonly used
for the simultaneous presentation of B-mode and doppler data.

## Waveforms

**What do normal spectral waveforms look like?**

[Normal spectral waveform:]{.ul}

Brisk upstroke, sharp peak, rapid downstroke. A spectral window under
the waveform, that is that black space between the spectral waveform and
the 0 velocity axis, represents the absence of lower velocities. This
is indicative of laminar flow within the vessel (Image 1: normal
spectrum waveform)

How can we differentiate high vs low resistance waveforms?

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab/Slide2.png"))

```

[Low vs high resistance waveforms:]{.ul}

Waveform profiles change depending upon the nature of the distal
vascular bed being supplied. Organs like the brain, kidneys, liver, and
spleen have constant high metabolic demand, and are therefore low
resistance vascular beds. Waveforms for arteries supplying these organs
demonstrate constant forward flow throughout the cardiac cycle because
the distal bed being supplied has low resistance leading to high
end-diastolic flow.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab/Slide3.png"))

```

This would also be seen in the postprandial SMA. In contrast, high
resistance waveforms are seen for arteries supplying resting peripheral
muscles, fasted mesenteric beds (such as the fasting SMA), and the
External carotid artery. High resistance waveforms are characterized by
triphasic morphology (preprandial  SMA or ECA).

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab/Slide4.png"))

```

That is, sharp peaks, early diastolic flow reversal, brief forward flow
from elastic recoil of the artery, and then no flow during the remainder
of the diastolic phase.

**How does flow-limiting stenosis change the waveform?**

First let's define **Stenosis:** A hemodynamically significant stenosis
(area reduction \>50%) will result in a doubling of velocity from the
inflow segment to the area of maximal stenosis (velocity ratio \> 2).

Now what do waveforms look like AFTER a flow-limiting stenosis?

[Tardus et parvus]{.ul} refers to a pattern of Doppler ultrasound
spectral waveform resulting from arterial stenosis. The tardus et parvus
waveform is delayed with prolonged systolic acceleration (tardus) and
diminished with a small systolic amplitude and rounded systolic peak
(parvus). This phenomenon is observed downstream from the site of
stenosis. Tardus parvus in the CFA? Upstream (iliac) stenosis. Tardus
parvus in the brachial artery? Upstream (subclavian or axillary)
stenosis.

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab/Slide5.png"))

```

**So what will the waveform look like BEFORE a flow-limiting stenosis?**

[Distal stenosis:]{.ul} Distal occlusive disease will result in a high
resistance waveform, with absent diastolic flow. (Image 5: Distal
stenosis with absent diastolic flow)

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/vasc_lab/Slide6.png"))

```

Now that we've covered the basics, let's move through by organ- system
high-yield vascular lab studies, findings, and pathologies.We'll start
with the extracranial evaluation, a highly-tested area of vascular
ultrasonography.

[**Extracranial:**]{.ul}

What does a typical extracranial evaluation involve?

-       Examine CCA (2 views), ICA (2 views), ECA, vertebral arteries

What are normal ICA and ECA waveforms?

-       **Normal ECA vs ICA waveform:**

The external carotid artery waveform reflects a high resistance vascular
bed. This means minimal diastolic flow. Conversely, the ICA waveform
reflects a low resistance vascular bed with antegrade diastolic flow.
(Image 6: normal ICA waveform) This makes sense, as the ICA is supplying
the brain while the ECA is supplying the face. Intuitively, the common
carotid artery  is a mixture of the ICA and ECA waveform morphologies.
Like the ICA with forward flow throughout diastole, but less as compared
to the ICA due to the high resistance influence of the ECA.

Another way of differentiating the external and internal carotid
arteries is the "temporal tap". Tapping on the superficial temporal
artery (a branch of the ECA) will be transmitted as small pulsations in
the diastolic component of the external carotid artery. (Image 7: ECA
waveform with temporal tap)

Can you talk about diagnostic criteria for ICA stenosis?

-       **Parameters for ICA stenosis:**

These are a few numbers that are (unfortunately) essential to memorize
for the VSITE and RPVI.

Although criteria differ between guidelines, the Carotid Consensus
Criteria, define ICA stenosis \>= 70% as a peak systolic velocity \>=
230 cm/sec, EDV \> 100 cm/sec, and ICA/CCA ratio \> 4.0. Of note,
post-stenting criteria vary from pre-stenting criteria. Stenosis
criteria are not clearly defined for the CCA or ECA. (Image 8: stenotic
ICA)

When is surgery indicated for ICA stenosis?

-       **Parameters for when surgery indicated**:

Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) \>60% stenosis
asymptomatic, NASCET \>50% stenosis symptomatic

Let's talk about other pathologies that can be visualized on
extracranial ultrasound:

-       **Pathologies:**

Stenosis (plaque), dissection (flap), aneurysms (rare), occlusion (no
flow, do not operate), carotid body tumor (splaying of ECA/ICA, fed by
ECA branches), FMD.

FMD is frequently encountered on the VSITE/RPVI. How would this appear
on the exams?

-       **Fibromuscular dysplasia** of the internal carotid arteries
affects women more commonly than men. Duplex findings show a "chain of
lakes" appearance, demonstrative of multiple septa and small aneurysms.
Velocity elevations and increased turbulence in the waveform patterns is
typically found on Doppler interrogation. (Image 9: Fibromuscular
dysplasia in the ICA) How to treat? Aspirin if asymptomatic, POBA if
symptomatic.

Are there other frequently tested pathologies demonstrated on
extracranial exam?

-       **Subclavian steal:** Subclavian steal occurs when a proximal
subclavian stenosis or occlusion leads to reversal of vertebral artery
flow. This causes "stealing" of  blood from the posterior cerebral
circulation, and presents as vertebrobasilar insufficiency. How does
this look on duplex? Normal vertebral flow looks very similar to ICA:
antegrade low resistance waveforms with constant forward flow throughout
the cardiac cycle. As subclavian stenosis progresses, one can see
mid-systolic velocity decelerations ('bunny ears") , and with severe
steal, there is a complete reversal of flow in the vertebral artery
towards the arm rather than towards the brain. (Image 10: subclavian
steal as demonstrated by mid-systolic decelerations in the vertebral
artery)

-       **Innominate stenosis:** A phenomenon that is related to this,
is innominate stenosis. Here again the patient will present with
vertebrobasilar insufficiency, indicative of diminished vertebral
antegrade flow, but additionally will experience right hemispheric
insufficiency secondary to diminished R ICA antegrade flow. The
right-side duplex will demonstrate flow reversal in the vertebral
artery, abnormal waveforms in the subclavian, as well as steal pattern
waveforms in the common and internal carotid arteries. The common
denominator for all of these findings is significant disease in the
innominate artery.

 

So that covers extracranial vascular lab evaluation. What about
intracranial? This is less frequently tested, so we will discuss just a
brief overview of views and some of the more commonly tested
pathologies.

[**Intracranial:**]{.ul}

-       Three primary views: temporal, foraminal (occipital), orbital
views

-          **Temporal view:** Used to interrogate PCA, ACA, MCA, and
ICA.

The MCA, ICA and PCA flow direction is towards the probe, the , The
ACA flow direction is AWAY.

-          **Occipital view:** Basilar and vertebral arteries (both
away).

-          **Orbital view:** Ophthalmic and ICA

-       Arteries differentiated by depth. MCA 3-6 cm, everything else
deeper.

What are some frequently tested pathologies that are identified on TCD?

-       **Indications often tested:**

-       **MCA spasm (severe PSV>200)**: Can be seen in sickle cell
disease with studies indicating a strong correlation between mean
velocities of \>200cm/s and the rate of stroke in children with sickle
cell disease. With blood transfusions, stroke risk can be reduced from
\>10% to \<1% per year.^[1](https://paperpile.com/c/NdGHca/WRZA)^

-       **Cerebral ischemia during CEA:** Comparing transcranial Doppler
sonography, near-infrared spectroscopy, stump pressure measurement, and
somatosensory evoked potentials, cerebral ischemia was most accurately
predicted by the percent change in transcranial Doppler detected middle
cerebral artery velocity. Detection of a greater than 50% drop in middle
cerebral artery velocity using transcranial Doppler is 100% sensitive
for detecting cerebral
ischemia.^[2](https://paperpile.com/c/NdGHca/m4Pw)^

-       TCD can also demonstrate microemboli (high spikes on spectral
doppler) during CEA

 

Having covered head and neck vasculature, let's move on to peripheral
vasculature. This is a huge area both on the VSITE/RPVI and in practice.
In this section we'll cover first the upper, then the lower extremity
vasculature.

So first, what are characteristics of waveforms in the peripheral
vasculature?

[**Peripheral:**]{.ul}

-       Normal waveforms are indicative of high resistance distal beds,
so we would expect triphasic waveforms

What are normal arterial parameters in the upper extremities?

[**Upper Extremity:**]{.ul}

-       **Normal parameters:** Normal pressure gradient between the
right and left brachial pressures is \<20 mmHg. Normal finger pressure
is \>80% of the ipsilateral brachial systolic pressure. So a normal
digital brachial index is \>=0.80. A gradient between digits of \>15
mmHg is considered abnormal. 

 

Let's talk about some of the most frequently tested pathologies,
starting with arterial TOS.

-          **Arterial TOS:** Results from compression of the subclavian
artery at the level of the first rib within the scalene triangle.
Arterial TOS testing is done by placing a sensor, most often
photoplethysmography (PPG), on one finger of each hand, recording the
resting waveforms and then recording while during maneuvers to evoke
arterial compression in the thoracic outlet.

Can you tell us a little more about PPG testing?

-          **Photoplethysmography (PPG)** uses an infrared light to
illuminate superficial tissue. The reflection is received by a
photosensor, and amplitude of the reflected light is proportional to the
volume of red blood cells in the sample area. A normal digital arterial
PPG has a brisk upstroke with a narrow systolic peak, and a dicrotic
notch on the downslope during diastole (Image 11: normal PPG). Digital
PPGs change with progression of peripheral vascular disease. The first
changes are a loss of amplitude and loss of the dicrotic notch. More
advanced disease findings include a flattened systolic peak and a
prolonged upstroke. Significant arterial TOS is suggested when there is
a loss or persistent flattening of the digit waveforms during any of the
positional changes that can compress the subclavian artery (either with
the clavicle, first rib and scalene muscle). However, it should be noted
that up to one-third of patients without arterial TOS may have some
degree of subclavian artery compression with positional maneuvers.

What are other diseases affecting the upper extremity?

-       **Raynaud's:** Vasospastic disorder characterized by temporary
vasospasm. Diagnosis may be assisted by decrease in digital waveforms
with immersion of the hand in cold water.

-          **Thromboangiitis obliterans:** Is a segmental
non-atherosclerotic inflammatory disorder characterized by
microthrombosis that primarily involves the small- and medium-sized
arteries. Ultrasonography may demonstrate the classical "corkscrew"
collateral development at the level of occlusion. TA has a male
predominance and first line treatment is smoking cessation.

 

Before we segue to the lower extremities, this is a good time to discuss
an entity frequently tested on the VSITE, and that constitutes for many
vascular surgeons a notable portion of their practice, and that is
hemodialysis access, and specifically fistulas.

[**Fistulas:**]{.ul}

Ultrasound is one of the key modalities used in identifying suitable
anatomy for fistula placement, suitability of a fistula for dialysis,
and finally complications of fistulas.

So first, assessment for fistula placement:

-       **Assessment for fistula placement:**

-       The optimal configuration for an AVF is determined on the basis
of vein mapping and noninvasive studies. Veins should measure \>3 mm in
diameter (>2.5 mm may be acceptable, as veins are likely to dilate under
anesthesia), and there should be no arterial inflow stenosis or venous
outflow stenosis. Duplex ultrasound arterial imaging can be performed at
the same time as vein mapping and can provide important predictors of
fistula maturation, such as arterial diameter and flow. The minimal
arterial lumen diameter is 2 mm.

How can we tell if a fistula is ready to be used for hemodialysis
access?

-          **Assessment for fistula suitability for dialysis:** Rule of
6's: At six weeks post-creation the diameter of the fistula should be at
least 6 mm and the depth no more than 0.6 cm. The flow rate should be at
least 600mL/min, and the length of the fistula should be 6 cm to allow
for a successful two-needle dialysis.

What do normal fistula spectral waveforms look like?

-          **Waveform:** The arterial waveform should demonstrate very
low resistance throughout diastole. End diastolic velocity should be one
half to two thirds of peak systolic velocity in a well-functioning
fistula. As a side note, this is also what one would see in an
iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula, as between the femoral artery and
vein.

Let's discuss commonly encountered complications and pathologies
identified in association with fistulas:

-       **Pathology:**

-          **Pseudoaneurysms:** Pseudoaneurysms commonly occur when a
puncture fails to seal and the blood is contained by the surrounding
soft tissue. As in other locations, pseudoaneurysms are defined on
imaging by a communicating neck between the arterial vessel and
pseudoaneurysmal sac with "to-and-fro" waveform at duplex. While small
pseudoaneurysms can be managed without intervention or surgery, larger
pseudoaneurysms, pseudoaneurysms associated with infection or overlying
skin changes or bleeding may require excision and repair.

-          **Steal syndrome:** Hemodialysis-related steal, also known as
access-related hand ischemia, which may occur in over half of all
patients undergoing access creation. Steal is characterized by
retrograde diastolic flow distal to the donor artery. Of note, reversal
of flow in and of itself is not sufficient to cause distal ischemia with
an intact palmar arch. This is commonly seen after access creation and
represents physiologic steal phenomenon, rather than symptomatic steal
syndrome. Digital pressures \<60 mm Hg are highly sensitive and specific
for predicting steal. Patients who have no symptoms (Grade 1
access-related hand ischemia), may be closely monitored without any
intervention. How do we treat more severe steal? Flow rate measurements
of the fistula can help determine the optimal treatment (banding,
revision using distal inflow, distal revascularization with interval
ligation, proximalization of arterial inflow or ligation of the
fistula).

So steal can occur in the context of high fistula output, can we talk a
bit about low fistula flow, as from stenosis?

-          **Central venous stenosis:** Venous outflow stenosis is the
most common reason for arteriovenous graft failure. A low flow rate
results in recirculation during the dialysis session. Venous obstruction
manifests as arm swelling, and with central venous stenosis may present
with collateral development over the upper extremity and chest wall.

-          **Stenosis of fistula:** Arterial and mid-graft stenosis can
also cause complications, but are less common than venous stenosis.
Stenosis on imaging will be represented by narrowing of luminal diameter
on b-mode ultrasound, high-resistance waveform proximal to the stenosis,
and tardus parvus waveform distal to the stenosis.

 

Awesome. So now that we've briefly covered fistulas, let's return to
peripheral vasculature, this time in the lower extremities.

 

[**Lower Extremity:**]{.ul}

 

Can you please tell us about some of the diagnostic modalities that are
used to examine perfusion in the lower extremities? 

-          **Diagnostic Modalities:**

-          **ABIs:** Ankle-brachial index measurement requires
calculating the ratio of the highest ankle systolic pressure (posterior
tibial artery or dorsalis pedis) over the highest brachial systolic
pressure. Regardless of whether you're doing the R or L ABI, use the
higher arm pressure for both ratios. Normal ABI \>0.9, severe disease
indicated by ABI\<0.5, and CLI by ABI\<0.3. The ankle-brachial index in
diabetic patients is frequently unreliable due to incompressibility of
the tibial vessels at the level of the cuff secondary to calcification.
Consequently, toe pressures are mandatory in all patients with diabetes
mellitus. Normal TBI>0.7.

-       **TcPO2:** When there is significant tissue loss, preventing TBI
measurement, another option is transcutaneous oximetry
(TcPO2).  Transcutaneous oximetry is a non-invasive method of measuring
the tissue partial pressure of oxygen through a heated sensor on the
skin. A TcPO2 value of 40 mmHg is the critical value below which wound
healing is impaired and ischemia develops.

Are there other non-invasive ways of determining extremity perfusion?

-          **PVRs:** Pulse volume recordings. Normal PVR waveforms have
a rapid upstroke, sharp peak, prominent dicrotic notch and downslope.
Typically 4 cuffs. High thigh cuff should be 30% greater than brachial
pressure, hence a thigh-brachial index of 1.3 is normal. However,
ABI/PVRs may not demonstrate significantly abnormal values/waveforms in
individuals with single level disease. (Image 12: PVRs- normal right leg
and abnormal left leg)

-          **Exercise Test:** During exercise testing, patients are
placed on a treadmill after baseline resting ABIs are measured. The
patient is then asked to walk for 5 minutes or until physical discomfort
requires test cessation. The point when a patient stops is defined as
the absolute claudication distance. Diagnostic criteria for a positive
test include a drop-in ankle pressure of greater than 20 mmHg from
baseline, drop in ABI greater than 0.2 from baseline, or inability of
ankle pressures to return to baseline after 3 minutes.

So just to briefly summarize, what are parameters associated with poor
wound healing?

-       **Parameters associated with poor wound healing:** Considering
these various testing modalities, what are factors associated with poor
likelihood of wound healing? An ankle pressure \<50 mmHg, ABI \< 0.40,
TcPO2 \<20 mmHg, or a toe pressure \<20 mmHg are considered predictive
of non-healing.

Ultrasound is frequently used for graft surveillance. Can you talk about
graft surveillance parameters?

-       **Restenosis/Graft surveillance:** Suggested ultrasound
surveillance bypass graft begins immediately after surgery and then
continues at 3, 6, and 12 months and then every 6 to 12 months
thereafter. A velocity ratio (Vr) is defined as the peak systolic
velocity (PSV) at the site of a stenosis divided by the PSV in a normal
vessel segment proximal to the stenosis. The highest risk for graft
thrombosis, and highest cause for concern is suggested by PSV \>300
cm/s, Vr \>3.5, a graft flow velocity \<45 cm/s or a drop in ABI
\>0.15.^[3](https://paperpile.com/c/NdGHca/OBYf)^

Let's talk about pathologies frequently encountered in the lower
extremities:

-       **Pathologies:**

-          **Pseudoaneurysms (particularly femoral):** Gray-scale
ultrasonography demonstrates a hypoechoic cystic structure adjacent to
an arterial supply. Color Doppler typically demonstrates a "yin-yang
sign" within the pseudoaneurysm sac. The hallmark ultrasound sign is
identification of a neck between the sac and the feeding artery with a
"to-and-fro" spectral Doppler waveform measured at the neck. This
represents the flow in and out of the PSA during systole and diastole
(Image 13: pseudoaneurysm with a "yin-yang sign").

-          **Dissections:** Characteristic ultrasound findings on color
Doppler include a parallel blood-flow channel that separates the true
and false lumen (Image 14: dissection). Of note, if the false lumen is
filled by a thrombus, it may not distinguishable from an intramural
hematoma or noncalcified plaque

There are several disease pathologies that are frequently tested
relating to the popliteal fossa. Can you talk briefly about these?

-          **Adventitial cystic disease:** This is a rare (but often
tested) pathology. Adventitial cystic disease is a nonatherosclerotic
etiology of claudication, most often affecting the popliteal artery in
the lower extremity and leading to stenosis or occlusion. Duplex imaging
of the popliteal artery will demonstrate an
anechoic *intraluminal* region with a smooth contour and stenosis
documented by velocity increase on spectral doppler (Image 15:
adventitial cystic disease).  This is not to be confused with a

-       **Bakers Cyst:** which is a benign, cystic structure found in
the popliteal fossa and arising from the joint capsule. Flexion of the
knee may result in compression of the popliteal artery by the cyst. On
b-mode ultrasound, a well-defined, anechoic  cystic structure with a
'neck' extending into the joint space between the semimembranosus tendon
and the medial head of the gastrocnemius will be identified (Image
16: Baker's cyst).

-       **Popliteal entrapment syndrome:** decrease in ABI or loss of
distal pulses with passive dorsiflexion or active plantar flexion of the
foot caused by compression of the popliteal artery by the gastrocnemius.

Now that we've covered the extremities, let's discuss ultrasound
evaluation of abdominal vasculature.

 

[**Abdominal:**]{.ul}

First, let's discuss the aorta and AAAs.

-       **Aortic Pathologies:**

-       **AAA:** Ultrasound screening of a AAA is non-invasive,
accurate, and cost-effective. Sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 99%
for AAA diagnosis. Size criteria for AAA repair is 5.5 cm men, 5.0-5.5
cm in women, measured outer wall to outer wall cross-sectional diameter.

Can ultrasound be used for graft surveillance s/p EVAR?

-       **S/p EVAR:** Surveillance color duplex ultrasound is safe if CT
imaging at 1 year exhibits no sac growth, graft migration, or endoleak
(or stable type II endoleak). Can detect endoleaks, sac expansion, and
limb occlusion. Migration difficult to assess given challenge of renal
arteries visualization in a long axis view of the aorta.

What other pathologies can be identified on ultrasound evaluation of the
abdomen?

-       **CIA aneurysms:** SVS defines CIA aneurysms as any permanent,
localized dilatation of the iliac artery \>1.5 cm in diameter (diameter
1.5x the normal diameter)

-       **Para-anastomotic pseudoaneurysms:** As previously discussed
(reported in up to 0.5% to 10% of cases)

-       **Penetrating aortic ulcers:** Describes an ulcerating
atherosclerotic lesion that penetrates the intima and progresses into
the media. Associated with atherosclerotic plaque on ultrasound

-       **Dissections:** (as already discussed) a dissection flap is
usually identified and color flow demonstrates dual channels (true and
false lumens). Turbulent flow patterns are frequently encountered.

So far we have steered clear of the mesenteric vasculature. But this is
an area frequently encountered on exams. Let's start with mesenteric
vessel stenosis.

-       **Mesenteric Pathologies:**

-       **Celiac and SMA stenosis:** May present as chronic mesenteric
ischemia. PSV \>275 cm/s in the SMA or \>200 cm/s in the celiac artery
indicates \>=70% stenosis. Normal SMA Doppler waveforms in the fasting
patient show high resistance waveform, PSV \<275 cm/s and no spectral
broadening. In the postprandial state, the waveform becomes low
resistance, with a slightly increased PSV and little to no spectral
broadening. Significant SMA stenosis may be differentiated by the
presence of spectral broadening and elevated PSV and EDV. Distal to the
stenosis, one would expect a tardus parvis waveform. EDV \>45 in SMA or
\>55 in celiac are predictive of stenosis (would expect higher diastolic
flow in celiac trunk given low resistance vascular bed of liver and
spleen).

What other mesenteric vessel pathologies may be identified on vascular
ultrasound?

-       **Dissections:** Rare without concomitant aortic dissection.

-       **Aneurysms:** Rare. Repair \>2 cm celiac, hepatic, SMA
aneurysms and \>3 cm splenic and renal.

-       **Median arcuate ligament syndrome:** MALS can cause
significantly elevated velocities at the origin of the celiac artery.
Testing is for reversible mechanical compression, as opposed to a fixed
lesion from atherosclerotic disease. During deep inspiration or in the
upright position, celiac velocities should normalize if stenosis is
secondary to MALS.

Ok, so I recognize that we are jumping ahead here discussing venous
circulation, but as this represents another component of a mesenteric
vascular exam, let's discuss portal venous ultrasonography.

-       **Portal vein:** Normal portal venous flow is hepatopetal
(toward the liver), whereas abnormal portal venous flow is hepatofugal
(away from the liver). (The root "fugua" means to flee, or flight). Flow
should be in the same direction as the hepatic artery. Other
abnormalities that may be visualized are portal vein thrombosis (often
associated with portal venous hypertension in patients with chronic
cirrhosis, hepatitis, or hepatocellular carcinoma). Acute portal vein
thrombosis on ultrasound demonstrates dilatation of the portal vein with
hypoechoic intraluminal thrombus. Chronic portal vein thrombosis is
characterized by a contracted vein with heterogeneous/hyperechoic echoes
and may be associated with collateral formation.  Can also assess for
hepatic artery stenosis/thrombosis and for functioning of TIPS
(transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt).

Awesome, and so before jumping fully into venous circulation, let's
complete our discussion of abdominal ultrasound evaluation with a
discussion of the renal vasculature.

-       **Renal Pathologies:** ostial (atherosclerotic) vs mid-artery
(FMD)

-       **Atherosclerotic stenosis:** PSV>200 cm/s predictive of \>60%
stenosis. Renal artery-to-aortic PSV ratio (RAR) \>3.5 also correlates
with a \>60% stenosis. The renal resistive index (RRI) is calculated as
the RA PSV-EDV/PSV. The RRI (>0.8) is an indicator of intrinsic
parenchymal renal disease.

-          **FMD:** As discussed for the carotids, FMD manifests as
beaded lesions in medium and small arteries, with the renal arteries the
most commonly affected. Ultrasound demonstrates increased PSV in the mid
and distal renal artery. Stenoses in the mid and distal renal artery are
suggestive of FMD, atherosclerotic disease is primarily ostial in
nature.

So far we've predominantly focused on arterial findings, let's discuss
venous vascular lab evaluations:

[**Venous:**]{.ul}

-       **Venous Exam:** Uses a linear transducer. Complete deep venous
reflux duplex examination includes color and pulsed wave spectral
doppler imaging. Spontaneous Doppler waveforms as well as provocative
maneuvers are recorded in the common femoral, femoral, popliteal, and
tibial deep veins. Superficial veins (GSV, SSV, and perforator veins)
are evaluated with provocative maneuvers to test valve competency.
Diameters are also included for superficial veins. Transverse B-mode
images are used for vessel compression (as when looking for thrombus) to
ensure that the vein is fully compressible under probe pressure as
opposed to simply slipping out of view, as may occur in longitudinal
views. Reflux exam should be performed with a patient standing, with
assessment performed on the non weight-bearing leg.

We've talked extensively about normal arterial waveforms; what do normal
venous waveforms look like?

-       **Normal venous waveforms:** Normal flow patterns of iliac and
femoral veins demonstrate phasicity and should augment with distal
compression. In the upper extremity central veins, doppler waveforms
normally demonstrate pulsatility and phasicity.

What does this mean? Pulsatility, phasicity, and augmentation?

**Pulsatility:** Refers to changes in the venous waveform in accordance
with the cardiac cycle. Pulsatility is normal in the upper extremity
veins central veins, given their proximity to the heart (Image 17:
pulsatility in an upper extremity vein). This is an abnormal finding in
the lower extremity veins, and may be a sign of pulmonary hypertension,
right heart failure, or tricuspid regurgitation.

**Phasicity:** (also called respiratory phasicity) is variation in the
waveform with respiration (Image 18: phasicity in a vein). This results
from increasing and decreasing intrathoracic pressures secondary to
respiration. Phasicity is an indicator of a patency proximal to the
point of measurement. So if we see lack of phasicity (continuous flow)
in the left femoral vein but normal phasicity in the right, we would be
concerned for left iliac vein occlusion or stenosis. If we saw absence
of phasicity (continuous flow) in the bilateral femoral veins, we would
be concerned for IVC obstruction or stenosis. 

**Augmentation:** Distal compression that augments forward flow (Image
19: augmentation in a lower extremity vein). For example, if we are
measuring flow at the femoral vein and we squeeze the calf and we see
augmentation in the waveform, this indicates lack of occlusion in the
venous system from the knee to the probe.

What are venous pathologies that are commonly tested/encountered?

-       **Pathologies:** 2 primary pathologies are reflux and
obstruction

-       **Reflux:** Venous reflux due to valvular incompetence is best
assessed with duplex scanning in the upright position. Reflux in the
common femoral vein and the saphenofemoral junction may be elicited with
a Valsalva maneuver (which increases intra-abdominal pressure), but
release of a pneumatic cuff compression is a more reproducible method.
Reflux is identified as reverse flow - that is, away from the heart -
following valsalva or release of the compression cuff (Image 20: reflux
in a lower extremity vein). Consensus guidelines suggest a cutoff value
of 1 second for abnormally reversed flow (reflux) in the femoral and
popliteal veins and of 0.5 seconds for the great saphenous vein, small
saphenous vein, tibial, and deep femoral veins.

-       **Perforator veins:** Perforator veins connect the deep and
superficial venous systems, penetrating the deep fascia overlying the
muscle.  Size \>3.5 mm and reflux \>350 ms (deep to superficial) is
associated with perforator reflux. Pathological perforator = in
association with a healed or non-healed ulcer.

What are some other examples of reflux?

-       **Ovarian vein reflux:** The ultrasound evaluation of pelvic
congestion syndrome is performed in steep reverse Trendelenburg and
standing positions with a low-frequency probe. Reflux is identified
during the Valsalva maneuver. There are no validated criteria for the
duration of reflux. Rather, an ovarian vein diameter \>6 mm is
considered significant.

-       **May Thurner:** Also known as iliac vein compression syndrome,
refers to a chronic compression of the left [common iliac
vein](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/common-iliac-vein?lang=us)by the
overlying right [common iliac
artery](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/common-iliac-artery?lang=us) (CIA),
with or without [deep venous
thrombosis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/deep-vein-thrombosis?lang=us).
Notably, patients present with unilateral (left) lower extremity edema
and pain, varicosities, DVT or venous ulcers. Intravascular ultrasound
will demonstrate \>50% stenosis of the iliac vein from compression.
Distal waveforms will demonstrate absence of phasicity if
obstruction/stenosis is severe with continuous flow.

Ok, let's transition from reflux to thrombosis:

-       **Thrombosis:** Characteristics of acute thrombus are an
echolucent and incompressible thrombus in a thin-walled vein with
significant distension (Image 21: non-compressible vein positive for
DVT). Acute thrombus typically causes the vein to dilate with a diameter
greater than the diameter of the adjacent artery. Venous wall
thickening/scarring, a contracted vein, recanalization, and
collateralization is found in chronic thrombosis.

Let's discuss 2 Specific examples of venous thrombosis: VTOS and EHIT

**Venous TOS:** Venous thoracic outlet syndrome is thrombosis or severe
stenosis of the subclavian or axillary veins secondary to chronic
extrinsic mechanical compression. Repetitive injury to the subclavian
vein at the level of the costoclavicular space results in chronic injury
to the veins. Venous duplex may show a dilated, non-compressible vein
consistent with an acute subclavian vein DVT, or lack of
pulsatility/phasicity if obstruction/stenosis is more centrally located.

**EHIT or Endovenous Heat Induced Thrombosis:** S/p endovenous thermal
ablations (RFA or laser ablation) of the GSV. 4 Grades: Grade 1 is
thrombus in the GSV up to the level of the CFV. If \< 50% of the CFV
lumen is involved this is EHIT grade 2. EHIT grade 3 is extension into
the CFV occupying \>50% of the lumen and grade 4 is occlusion of the CFV
(Image 22: EHIT Grade 2). EHIT grades 3-4 are typically treated with
anticoagulation to reduce risk of PE. To minimize the risk of EHIT, the
catheter should be positioned at least 2 cm from the saphenofemoral
junction.

 

Finally, let's wrap up this episode with a discussion of imaging
artifacts. These are frequently encountered and tested in vascular
ultrasound, and it is important to recognize imaging artifacts in order
to prevent incorrect interpretation.

[**Artifacts:**]{.ul}

-       **Acoustic shadowing:** Shadowing on an ultrasound image is
characterized by a signal void behind structures that strongly absorb,
reflect, or refract ultrasonic waves (Image 23: acoustic shadowing).
Practically speaking, this most typically occurs deep to strongly
reflective surfaces such as calcified plaques, and appears as a "dark
area" beneath the plaque. **Acoustic enhancement** is essentially the
inverse situation, and appears as a "bright area" deep to structures
that transmit ultrasound waves exceptionally well. This can happen deep
to fluid-filled structures such as cysts.

-       **Mirroring**: A mirror-image artifact is caused by
reverberation of ultrasound and shows structures that exist on one side
of a strong reflector as also being present on the other side of the
reflector (Image 24: mirror-image artifact).This is often seen around
the pleura and the diaphragm, due to the strong reflection of ultrasound
from the air-filled lung. These artifacts can occur in both B-mode
imaging where you see the mirrored image and Doppler, in which you see
the mirrored waveform.

-       **Refraction:** A refraction artifact is the result of
ultrasound waves passing through tissues with different propagation
velocities (such as air and water) and causes a structure to be
improperly positioned laterally in the image. This is the phenomenon
that results in a straw appearing bent when in a glass of water.

-       **Speed artifact:** Depth determination by an ultrasound machine
is based on calculations using an average propagation velocity of sound
in soft tissue of 1540 m/s. If the ultrasound wave passes through a
medium at a different speed than predicted by the machine, an inaccurate
image depth will be displayed. If the ultrasound passes less quickly
through the material than soft tissue (as occurs in air or fluid), then
the image will be displayed deeper than the true depth. In practical
application, this is what causes a "bayonet" sign, or apparent bending
of a needle when it passes from soft tissue into a cystic structure.

-       **Inappropriate color gain:** Overly gained images will show
"speckling" in areas in which no flow is present (such as in soft
tissue) (Image 25: color over-gaining). Under-gaining will result in
reduced sensitivity to low velocity flow.

-       **Inappropriate angle correction:** Make sure the angle
correction cursor is centered in the vessel and parallel to the walls,
otherwise the Doppler velocity measurement will be incorrect (Image 26:
inappropriate angle correction).

Finally, can we talk about aliasing, as I feel like this comes up a lot
on exams:

-       **Aliasing:** Unlike [continuous wave
Doppler](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/continuous-wave-doppler?lang=us),
pulsed wave and color flow Doppler are characterized by rapid pulses of
ultrasound waves (at a rate called the pulse repetition frequency).
The [Nyquist
limit](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/nyquist-limit?lang=us) defines
the frequency at which aliasing will occur, as equal to the PRF/2. So
what does this mean practically? In pulsed wave doppler, if the velocity
of blood is greater than ½ the PRF, the peak velocity will be cut off,
and wrapped around to the bottom of the scale (Image 27: Doppler
aliasing). This results in inaccurate measurement of peak velocities,
and may be remedied by increasing the PRF and hence the scale. In color
flow doppler, aliasing appears as red to blue hues without separation of
a black region indicating no flow. This occurs in areas of high velocity
(such as immediately post-stenosis). This can be remedied with an
increase in the color scale. Of note, if asked to determine the
direction of blood flow in a vessel demonstrating aliasing, one should
assess the flow in low-velocity areas of blood flow, as seen along
vessel walls.
