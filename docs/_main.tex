\item
  \textbf{What is the definition of crescendo TIAs?}

  Frequent repetitive neurological attacks without complete resolution
  of the deficit between the episodes, producing the same deficit but
  no progressive deterioration in neurological function If a
  progressive deterioration then it is a stroke in evolution.
\item
  \textbf{Who needs to be screened?}

  Only 15\% of stroke victims have a warning TIA before a stroke so
  waiting until symptoms occur is not ideal. The purpose of carotid
  bifurcation imaging is to detect ``stroke-prone'' carotid bifurcation
  plaque and identify a high-risk patient likely to benefit from
  therapy designed to reduce stroke risk.

  The absence of a neck bruit does not exclude the possibility of a
  significant carotid bifurcation lesion - focal ipsilateral carotid
  bruits in symptomatic patients has a sensitivity of 63\% and a
  specificity of 61\% for high-grade carotid stenosis (range, 70\%-99\%).

  Screening of the general population is not indicated. Screening
  should be considered for patients with:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Evidence of clinically significant peripheral vascular disease
    regardless of age
  \item
    Patients aged \textgreater65 years with a history of one or more of the
    following atherosclerotic risk factors:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      CAD
    \item
      Smoking
    \item
      Hypercholesterolemia
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    In general, the more risk factors present, the higher the yield
    of screening should be expected.
  \item
    The benefit of prophylactic treatment of high grade stenosis is
    estimated at a 1-2\% stroke reduction risk per year.
    \citet{naylorWhyManagementAsymptomatic2015}
  \item
    Keep in mind that intervention (CEA/CAS) has only demonstrated a
    benefit in asymptomatic patient with life expectancy greater
    than 3 years. \citep{bulbuliaAsymptomaticCarotidSurgery2017, halliday10yearStrokePrevention2010, rosenfieldRandomizedTrialStent2016}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{US findings that confirm disease}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    50-69\% stenosis of ICA - Low sensitivity for 50-69\% stenosis - a
    negative ultrasound in symptomatic patients necessitates
    additional imaging

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      PSV 125-229 cm/sec
    \item
      EDV 40-100
    \item
      Internal/Common Carotid PSV Ratio 2-4
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    70-99\% stenosis of ICA

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      PSV \textgreater/= 230 cm/sec
    \item
      EDV \textgreater100 (EDV \textgreater{} 140 cm/sec most sensitive for stenosis \textgreater80\%)
    \item
      Internal/Common Carotid PSV Ratio \textgreater{} 4
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Velocity-based estimation of carotid artery stenosis may need to
    be adjusted in certain circumstances

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Higher velocities in women than in men
    \item
      Higher velocities in the presence of contralateral carotid
      artery occlusion.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    High carotid bifurcation, severe arterial tortuosity, extensive
    vascular calcification, and obesity may also reduce the accuracy
    of DUS imaging
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Other Imaging Modalities}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    CTA

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Pro - fast, sub-millimeter spatial resolution, visualize
      surrounding structures
    \item
      Con - cost, contrast exposure
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    MRA

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Pro - no contrast administered; analyze plaque morphology
    \item
      Con - Does not visualize calcium in plaque; overestimates
      the degree of stenosis (False positive for 50-69\% to be read
      as \textgreater70\%)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Catheter-based digital subtraction imaging (DSA)

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Still considered by many the gold-standard imaging modality
    \item
      Reserved for individuals with conflicting less-invasive
      imaging or those considered for CAS
    \item
      Con - cost and risk of stroke
    \end{itemize}

\hypertarget{optimal-medical-therapy}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Optimal medical therapy}}{Optimal medical therapy}}\label{optimal-medical-therapy}}

\textbf{Hypertension}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Lowering blood pressure to a target \textless140/90 mmHg by lifestyle
  interventions and anti-hypertensive treatment is recommended in
  individuals who have hypertension with asymptomatic carotid
  atherosclerosis or those with TIA or stroke after the hyper-acute
  period.
\item
  Each 10-mm Hg reduction in blood pressure among hypertensive
  patients decreases the risk for stroke by 33\%.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Diabetes}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Glucose control to nearly normoglycemic levels (target hemoglobin
  A1C \textless7\%) is recommended among diabetic patients to reduce
  microvascular complications and, with lesser certainty,
  macrovascular complications other than stroke.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Lipid abnormalities}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Risk of stroke decreased by \textgreater15\% for every 10\% reduction in serum
  LDL in patients with known coronary or other atherosclerosis
\item
  Statin agents are recommended targeting LDL of 100 mg/dL, for those
  with coronary heart disease or symptomatic atherosclerotic disease,
  and LDL of 70 mg/dL for very high-risk persons with multiple risk
  factors
\item
  High dose statin therapy in patients with TIA/stroke reduce future
  rates of stroke or cardiovascular events but not overall mortality
  at 5 years. \citet{karamHighDoseAtorvastatinStroke2008}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Smoking} - Physician counseling is an important and effective
intervention that reduces smoking in patients by 10\% to 20\%

\textbf{Antithrombotic therapy} - There is no evidence to suggest that
antiplatelet agents other than aspirin have improved benefit in
asymptomatic patients with carotid atherosclerosis

\hypertarget{carotid-endarterectomy}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Carotid endarterectomy}}{Carotid endarterectomy}}\label{carotid-endarterectomy}}

\textbf{Timing}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Recommendations on when to operate after a stroke

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Acute stroke with a fixed neurologic deficit of \textgreater6h duration -
    When the patient is medically stable, treatment in less than or
    equal to 2 weeks after the stroke is preferable.
    \citep{rothwellEndarterectomySymptomaticCarotid2004, meershoekTimingCarotidIntervention2018}
  \item
    Consider urgent intervention in a medically stable patient with
    mild-moderate neurologic deficit, if there is a significant area
    of ischemic penumbra at risk for progression
  \item
    Stroke in evolution (fluctuating / evolving neuro deficit) or
    crescendo TIA (repetitive transient ischemia w improvement
    between events) - If neuro status is not stabilized by medical
    intervention consider urgent CEA
  \item
    CEA is preferred to CAS based on an increased embolic potential
    of carotid lesions that present in this fashion.
    \citet{rantnerEarlyEndarterectomyCarries}
  \item
    Management of acute stroke \citet{powers2018GuidelinesEarly2018}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \textless4.5hrs from onset of symptoms - tPA unless
      contraindication

      \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Age \textgreater80 and diabetes are contraindication to tPA after
        3hrs.
      \item
        Other contraindications - high BP, intracranial
        hemorrhage, recent stroke or head trauma, spine/brain
        surgery within 3mo, GI bleed within 21d
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      \textless6hr from onset of symptoms - catheter directed therapy
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  What is the only emergent indication for CEA?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Crescendo TIAs or a stroke in evolution with a surgically
    correctable lesion that is identified
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Intraoperative Techniques}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  General concepts

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Patch angioplasty or eversion endarterectomy are recommended
    rather than primary closure to reduce the early and late
    complications of CEA (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Neuromonitoring/Shunting options during a carotid endarterectomy

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Local anesthesia with direct neuro monitoring - the patient is
    awake and moving to command throughout the case. Though improved
    neuromonitoring has not been shown to reduce MI rate with CEA
  \item
    Stump pressure Clamp the inflow and place butterfly attached to
    a-line tubing into the internal carotid If stump pressure is \textgreater{}
    40 mmHg can proceed, if \textless{} 40 place shunt
  \item
    EEG Neuromonitoring - EEG tech places neuromonitoring, monitored
    by intraop tech and neurologist remotely, generally clamp ICA
    for 3 minutes before proceeding, if any deficits unclamp, await
    normalization of EEG then proceed
  \item
    Non-selective shunting - shunt all carotids
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Techniques to reach internal carotid lesions that are high?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Nasotracheal intubation will help extend the neck to reach
    higher lesions
  \item
    Divide posterior belly of digastric to reach high lesions with
    care to watch for glossopharyngeal
  \item
    Styloidectomy
  \item
    Mandible subluxation with assistance from ENT if previous
    techniques fail.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  What is the best technique for a patient with a kinked internal
  carotid artery?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Eversion carotid endarterectomy will allow you to reduce the
    redundancy
  \item
    Otherwise, no advantage has been shown between eversion or
    patch, both can be shunted
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Discuss nerve injuries -- where you would encounter these and what
  deficit would be seen

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Hypoglossal Just above the bifurcation of the carotid artery
    Will see tongue deviation to the side of injury
  \item
    Glossopharyngeal High dissections under digastric Difficulty
    swallowing, aspiration risk, can be devastating
  \item
    Vagus Adjacent and lateral to carotid, injury occurs with
    carotid clamping, Hoarseness is noted as RLN is a branch off of
    vagus
  \item
    Marginal Mandibular (Off of facial nerve) Retraction at the
    angle of the jaw for high dissections Leads to the corner of lip
    drooping, can be confused with a neuro deficit following the
    case
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Postoperative Complications}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  What to do if neuro deficits following your carotid endarterectomy

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If in OR -- perform duplex, if normal open wound and shoot
    cerebral angiogram
  \item
    If in Recovery or on the floor -- many would consider CTA first
    vs duplex to look for thrombosis
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Risk factors and how to manage hyperperfusion syndrome?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Defined as an ipsilateral headache, hypertension, seizures, and
    focal neurological deficits can present 2-3 days out from
    surgery
  \item
    Patients with uncontrolled hypertension are at risk for
    hyperperfusion syndrome, clinical practice guidelines by SVS
    recommend strict BP control following CEA, maintain a pressure
    less than 140/80
  \end{itemize}
\item
  High risk groups

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ESRD patients have higher rates of perioperative stroke, but
    also have higher rates of stroke if not revascularized.
    \citet{klarinPerioperativeLongtermImpact2016}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Long term complications and follow up}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Recommend f/u US at \textless/=30 days. \textgreater/= 50\% stenosis requires further
  imaging.
\item
  Contralateral stenosis

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The risk of progression for moderate stenosis at the initial
    surveillance to severe stenosis can be as high as five times
  \item
    Requires post-operative surveillance.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{carotid-artery-stenting}{%
\subsection{Carotid Artery Stenting}\label{carotid-artery-stenting}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In patients aged \textgreater70 undergoing CAS the risk of stroke was the
  highest, presumably due to calcific disease in the arch

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Lesion-specific characteristics are thought to increase the risk
    of cerebral vascular events after CAS and include a ``soft''
    lipid-rich plaque identified on noninvasive imaging, extensive
    (15 mm or more) disease, a pre-occlusive lesion, and
    circumferential heavy calcification
  \item
    This can be reduced, but not eliminated, by using flow-reversal
    embolic protection rather than distal filter protection
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Limited data on CAS in asymptomatic patients - currently is not
  supported by guidelines or considered reimbursable
\item
  Consider CAS in symptomatic patients with \textgreater50\% stenosis who are poor
  candidates for CEA due to severe uncorrectable medical comorbidities
  and/or anatomic considerations

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Ipsilateral neck dissection or XRT - equivalent periprocedural
    stroke rate to CEA, but increased later stroke rate. CEA higher
    rates of cranial nerve damage (9\%).
    \citet{giannopoulosRevascularizationRadiationinducedCarotid2018}
  \item
    Contralateral vocal cord paralysis
  \item
    Lesions that extend proximally to the clavicle or distal to C2
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Transfemoral Approach vs Transcarotid approach

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ROADSTER Trial - single arm study with flow reversal for
    cerebral protection. Suggest lower rates of post-op stroke
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Post-op follow up - Dual-platelet therapy should be continued for 1
  month after the procedure, and aspirin should be continued
  indefinitely

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In stent restenosis (\textgreater50\%) - repeat angioplasty or stent have
    low incidence of periprocedural stroke but failed to improve
    long term stroke/death/MI or patency rates.
    \citet{chungPercutaneousInterventionCarotid2016a}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{management-of-uncommon-disease-presentations}{%
\subsection{Management of uncommon disease presentations}\label{management-of-uncommon-disease-presentations}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Occluded Carotid What to do for occluded carotid?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Leave it alone
  \end{itemize}
\item
  What if occluded carotid is still causing TIAs?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    External carotid endarterectomy and ligation of internal
  \item
    The addition of oral anticoagulation is likely to reduce the
    rate of recurrent CVA
  \end{itemize}
\item
  What if the patient has severe vertebrobasilar insufficiency and
  carotid artery disease?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Should undergo carotid revascularization first to improve flow
  \item
    Vertebrobasilar insufficiency characterized by dizziness,
    ataxia, nausea, vertigo and bilateral weakness.
    \citet{limanetoPathophysiologyDiagnosisVertebrobasilar2017}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  What about tandem lesions in the carotid in a symptomatic patient,
  carotid bulb and carotid siphon lesion (high ICA)? How should you
  treat this?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Treat carotid bulb first, likely the embolic source
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Carotid artery dissection

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Patients with carotid dissection should be initially treated
    with antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet agents or
    anticoagulation) (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence C).
  \item
    Indications for endovascular treatment of carotid artery
    dissection \citep{cohenSinglecenterExperienceEndovascular2012, markusAntiplateletTherapyVs2019a, phamEndovascularStentingExtracranial2011}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Ongoing symptoms on best medical therapy
    \item
      Contraindication to antithrombotics
    \item
      Pseudoaneurysm
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Simultaneous coronary and carotid disease

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis will benefit from CEA
    before or concomitant with CABG. The timing of the intervention
    depends on the clinical presentation and institutional
    experience (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B).
  \item
    Patients with severe bilateral asymptomatic carotid stenosis,
    including stenosis and contralateral occlusion, should be
    considered for CEA before or concomitant with CABG (GRADE 2,
    Level of Evidence B)
  \item
    Patients undergoing simultaneous CEA/CABG demonstrate highest
    mortality. \citet{naylorSystematicReviewOutcomes2003}

  Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Compared medical management with CEA in asymptomatic patients
    with \textgreater{} 60\% stenosis
  \item
    5-year stroke and death rate was 5.1\% vs 11\%
  \item
    In women, the benefit of CEA was not as certain as 5y stroke and
    death rates were 7.3\% vs.~8.7\%
  \item
    This was pre statin and clopidogrel era
  \end{itemize}
\item
  North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET)
  \citet{northamericansymptomaticcarotidendarterectomytrialcollaboratorsBeneficialEffectCarotid1991}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Compared medical management vs CEA for symptomatic patients with
    moderate (50-69\%) and severe stenosis (\textgreater70\%)
  \item
    Only moderate impact for patients with moderate stenosis
    (50-69\%)
  \item
    Symptomatic patients with \textgreater70 \% stenosis benefited from CEA, at
    18 months 7\% major stroke in surgical arm, and a 24\% stroke rate
    in medical arm. 29\% reduction in 5-year risk of stroke or death

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Patients with severe \textgreater70\% stenosis had such a dramatic
      effect the trial was stopped early for this subset and all
      referred for endarterectomy
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    No benefit is shown in symptomatic patients with \textless{} 50\% stenosis
  \item
    European studies have shown similar results

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      ACST = ACAS
    \item
      ECST = NASCET.
    \end{itemize}

\item
  Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial
  (CREST)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Compared CEA vs.~CAS in both symptomatic and asymptomatic
    patients.
  \item
    Composite endpoint of 30-day stroke, MI, death equivalent
    between CEA and CAS
  \item
    CAS had a significantly higher incidence of stroke and death
    than CEA and CEA higher incidence of MI

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Follow up at 10 years demonstrated no difference in
      composite stroke/MI/death but increased rate of stroke/death
      in stented patients likely attributable to increased
      periprocedural stroke. \citet{brottLongTermResultsStenting2016b}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Subanalyses identified that older patients (\textgreater70y) had better
    outcomes after CEA than CAS, the QOL impact of stroke was more
    significant than that of MI, and anatomic characteristics of
    carotid lesions (longer, sequential, remote) were predictive of
    increased stroke and death after CAS
  \item
    Unfortunately, this study provides a benchmark to strive for,
    but no other large trials have achieved these results.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  ROADSTER

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Single arm feasibility trial of transcarotid carotid stenting
  \item
    The results of the ROADSTER trial demonstrate that the use of
    the ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS is safe and effective at preventing
    stroke during CAS. The overall stroke rate of 1.4\% is the lowest
    reported to date for any prospective, multicenter clinical trial
    of CAS.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Trials to look out for in the next few years

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    CREST-2 - multicenter, randomized controlled trial is underway
    that is evaluating revascularization against modern intensive
    medical management
  \item
    ACT-1 and ACST-2- the role of intervention in asymptomatic
    patients, designed to compare the early and long-term results of
    CEA vs CAS and best medical management

Division of the upper extremity into three zones:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Intrathoracic zone including aortic arch, innominate artery,
  subclavian artery bilaterally, innominate veins, and SVC
\item
  Thoracic outlet (base of neck to the axilla including the
  subclavian, proximal vertebral, proximal axillary arteries/veins)
\item
  Axilla to fingers (the arm)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What are some common exposures for major upper extremity arteries?}

Right Subclavian Artery: Medial sternotomy (proximal) or right
supraclavicular area (mid/distal)

Left Subclavian Artery: Anterolateral thoracotomy in emergent setting
for proximal left subclavian artery control. When third space
sternotomy, supraclavicular incision with thoracotomy ``trap door''
exposure

Supraclavicular incision: After division of the platysma and clavicular
head of the SCM, fat pat of varying thickness contains the omohyoid
muscle. This should be divided and placed superiorly/laterally. At this
point, the anterior scalene muscle is exposed medially with phrenic
nerve running in lateral to medial direction. Division of anterior
scalene for carotid/subclavian bypass should be performed as close to
the first rib as possible. After this is performed, the subclavian
artery is exposed.

Axillary Artery: Infraclavicular exposure below middle 1/3rd of
clavicle. Pec major split and pec minor freed at lateral wound. Axillary
vein followed by deep and superior to get to artery

Anatomically bound by the first rib proximally and the lateral edge of
the teres major muscle distally. For exposure of the first part of the
axillary artery, the ipsilateral arm is abducted approximately 90
degrees and horizontal skin incision 2 cm below the middle third of the
clavicle. Underlying pec major is split by bluntly separating the fibers
and followed by exposing the tough clavipectoral fascia. At the lateral
wound, the pec minor can be freed and laterally retracted. The axillary
vein is first structure encountered in the sheath and the artery lies
just superior and deep to the vein. Make sure to avoid nerves of
brachial plexus that lie deep to first part of axillary artery and are
at risk for injury during blind placement of occluding arterial clamps.
\citet{garygwindAnatomicExposuresVascular2013}

\textbf{What steps are involved for brachial artery exposure?}

Brachial artery: incision between biceps/triceps on medial arm (avoid
basilic vein damage in subcutaneous and deep to the fasia at medial
biceps. Median nerve seen and retracted. Two brachial vein are paired
adjacent to artery.

Superficial location makes it vulnerable to injury and accounts for most
vascular injuries of upper extremities. Brachial artery exposure
involves a 5-8 cm longitudinal incision in the groove between the
biceps/triceps muscles on the medial aspect of the arm. In the lower
half of the arm, take care to avoid basilic vein damage in the
subcutaneous tissue. Neurovascular bundle exposed by incising the deep
fascia at the medial border of the biceps muscle, which is retracted
anteriorly. After retracting basilic vein into posterior wound ,brachial
sheath is opened and median nerve is most superficial structure and
retracted. The artery lies deep to the nerve and surrounded by two
brachial veins. Posteriorly, is the presence of the ulnar nerve.

Brachial Artery bifurcates at the radial tuberosity into radial/ulnar
branches. After the bifurcation and immediately after its origin, the
ulnar artery gives off a short common interosseous branch, which
bifurcates at the hiatus in the proximal interosseous membrane. Exposure
of brachial artery in the antecubital fossa requires a transverse skin
incision 1 cm distal to the midpoint of the antecubital crease. After
deepening, avoid injury to subcutaneous veins and mobilize the basilic
vein medially. Medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve should be protected.
Divide the bicipital aponeurosis and after division, exposure of the
brachial artery is present, which is flanked by two deep veins and
crossing branches. Isolation of brachial artery requires ligation and
division of these crossing vein branches.

Radial artery at the wrist with 2-3 cm longitudinal incision generally
between radial artery and cephalic vein. Radial artery was exposed by
incising the antebrachial fascia just medial to the radius. Two veins
accompany the artery and should be dissected away during arterial
isolation. The superficial radial nerve and its medial/lateral branches
course between the cephalic vein and radial artery in the area.

Exposure of the ulnar artery is by coursing beneath the superficial
flexor muscles in the proximal forearm, emerging near the ulnar border
at the point midway between the elbow and the wrist. In the distal
forearm, the ulnar artery course just beneath the antebrachial fascia
and is easily exposed through a longitudinal incision placed radial to
the flexor carbi ulnaris. The palmar branch of the ulnar nerve courses
the superficial to the antebrachial fascia and should be preserved
during arterial exposure

\textbf{What common aberrant upper extremity/arch anatomy is important to be
aware of?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Bovine arch with left common carotid/left subclavian have common
  origin
\item
  Vertebral artery directly off the aortic arch
\item
  Aberrant right subclavian where innominate becomes right CCA and
  right subclavian distal to last branch on left side passing behind
  esophagus to supply the right arm
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How does evaluation of upper extremity ischemia differentiate from
lower extremity ischemia?} \citet{shuja117UpperExtremity}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Upper extremity ischemia \textless5\% of patients with limb ischemia and in
  contrast to lower extremity, atherosclerosis is not a major
  contributor to upper extremity ischemia
\item
  Vast majority of cases caused by autoimmune/connective tissue
  disorders
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How can upper extremity disease be classified?}

Anatomic Location:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Large vs.~Small Vessel
\end{itemize}

Disease Process:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Vasospastic or occlusive. Vasospastic disease is more responsive to
  pharmacologic management while occlusive requiring
  endovascular/surgical management.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How should patients be evaluated who have concern for upper extremity
disease?}

Diagnostic Evaluation

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Detailed H+P evaluation (pulse palpation, auscultation at
  supraclavicular/infraclavicular fossa may reaveal a bruit concerning
  for subclavian artery stenosis, upper extremity neurovascular/skin
  exam)
\item
  Brachial/forearm blood pressures and if suspected claudication,
  measured at rest and 2-5 minutes after exercise. Look for a gradient
  of \textgreater20 mmHg is considered significant
\item
  Some or all of 6 P's of acute limb ischemia with symptoms occurring
  within 14 days are deemed acute
\item
  Doppler insonation of radial, ulnar, palmar, and digital arteries
\item
  Vascular Lab Evaluation

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Segmental Pressure Measurements
  \item
    Duplex Ultrasound (look for large vessel occlusive disease)
  \end{enumerate}
\item

\section{Vaso-occlusive disease}\label{vaso-occlusive-disease}}

\textbf{What are causes and symptoms associated with subclavian/axillary
occlusive disease?} \citet{jacklcronenwettVascularDecisionMaking2020}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Etiology: Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of
  subclavian/axillary occlusive disease. Left SCA \textgreater{} Right involvement.
  Less common causes include Takayasu disease, giant cell arteritis,
  or arterial TOS
\item
  Symptoms: Upper extremity arm/hand ischemia or neurologic symptoms
  due to subclavian-vertebral steal. Because significant collaterals,
  minimal pain on exertion even with subclavian occlusion
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are causes and symptoms associated with brachial/forearm
occlusive disease?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Etiology: MCC of brachial artery occlusion is cardiac origin
  embolus. Atherosclerosis RARELY affects the brachial artery. Distal
  axillary/proximal brachial stenosis can be from repetitive trauma
  from crutch use.~
\item
  Forearm occlusive disease can be seen in advanced ESRD/DM where
  calcific atherosclerosis of radial/ulnar arteries is present. Less
  common causes include Beurger disease or Raynaud Phenomenon~
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How/when is upper extremity occlusive disease treated?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  SCA Occlusive Disease

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Endovascular: treated with stenting if they are short segment
    and not close to the vertebral artery origin. Balloon expandable
    stents favorable for ostial lesions and access can be via the
    femoral or ipsilateral brachial artery~
  \item
    Surgery:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Bypass from aortic arch through median sternotomy~
    \item
      Ipsilateral CCA to subclavian artery (bypass or
      transposition)~
    \item
      Contralateral CCA (anterior or retropharyngeal)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Brachial/forearm Occlusive disease~

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Endovascular: PTA evidence is anecdotal with stents for lesions
    unresponsive to PTA or dissection following angioplasty~
  \item
    Surgery:~

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      GSV vein bypass remains standard for revascularization with
      bypasses to superficial or deep palmar arch have good
      patency rates. Tunneling is subcutaneous if to distal ulnar
      or superficial palmar arch whereas anatomical to distal
      radial artery over the anatomic snuffbox~

\section{Vasospastic Disorders}\label{vasospastic-disorders}}

\textbf{What is Raynaud's and what causes it?} \citep{shuja117UpperExtremity, landry141RaynaudPhenomenon2019}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Exaggeration of normal physiologic response with episodic pallor or
  cyanosis of the fingers caused by small digital artery
  vasoconstriction occurring in response to cold or emotional stress.
  There is an abnormality with sympathetic nervous system, resulting
  in a multifactorial problem involving a combination of vascular,
  neural, and humoral factors.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are the subtypes of Raynaud's phenomenon and what is the
underlying pathology?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Primary: Raynaud's disease-idiopathic form that is a benign process
  not associated with structural vascular change. Triggers include
  (cold, emotional stress, caffeine) resulting in digital smooth
  muscle contraction and temporary digital hypoperfusion.
\item
  Secondary: Fixed vascular obstruction to blood flow decreasing
  threshold for cold induced vasospasm or progress to tissue loss.
  Diseases associated include mixed connective tissue disease, SLE,
  and rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma (accounts for 80-90\% of
  cases). In setting of lower digital blood pressure, symptomatic
  digital ischemia or tissue loss under low stress conditions. With
  cold/emotional stress, vasoconstrictive response of digital artery
  smooth muscle further causes arterial closure and resultant symptoms
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are diagnostic criteria for Raynaud's?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Clinical (Progression of ischemia with white -\textgreater{} blue -\textgreater{} red finger
  discoloration. Episodes can be self-limited and may last from less
  than a minute, but generally not longer than 10-20 minutes~
\item
  Qualitative testing for severity of cold sensitivity in Raynaud's
  syndrome can be useful. Most basic test is cold sensitivity and
  recovery after ice water immersion. \textgreater10 minutes return to baseline
  pressure concerning for Raynaud's
\item
  Segmental pressures with finger systolic blood pressure can
  differentiate purely vasospastic vs occlusive disease. Difference of
  more than 15 mm Hg between fingers or absolute finger pressure \textless70
  mm Hg may indicate occlusive disease~
\item
  Serologic evaluation (ANA/RF)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are appropriate treatments for Raynaud's phenomenon?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Medical-cold/tobacco avoidance. Calcium channel blocker (nifedipine)
  has been the most effective and losartan has also been beneficial.
  Fluoxetine (SSRI). Other drugs include alpha blocker, sildenafil,
  reserpine, cilostazol, captopril. NOT GOOD OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH
  ARTERIAL OBSTRUCTION~
\item
  Surgical-thoracic sympathectomy (used for treatment of digital
  artery vasospasm/digital ischemic ulceration). For vasospasm,
  thoracic sympathetcomy is initially successful, but symptoms return
  generally within 3-6 months.~
\item
  Immunosuppression/immunomodulation for connective tissue disorders
  associated with secondary Raynaud phenomenon
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Ergotism}}{Ergotism}}\label{ergotism}}

\textbf{What is Ergotism?} \citet{jamescstanleyCurrentTherapyVascular2014}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Etiology: Ergot is a parasitic fungal disease that has a particular
  prevalence for infecting rye plants and ergot alkaloids have been
  linked to epidemic poisonings that manifested as ergotism from
  consumption of rye~
\item
  Modern day is rare
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What causes Ergotism and how do patients present?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ergotamine is chemically like endogenous catecholamines/indolamines
  and when applied clinically, it behaves as an agonist to
  alpha-adrenergic, sertoninergic, and dopaminergic receptors. Despite
  limited bioavailability, vasocontrictive effects have been reported
  to last for 24 hours or longer~
\item
  Gangrenous-mild limb pain followed by burning pain/shooting and~
\item
  Convulsive-heaviness in limbs and head associated with diarrhea.
  Could result in tonic-clonic spasms~
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How can you diagnose Ergotism and what is the process for treating
this disease?}

Upper extremity ischemia (i.e.~digital ulceration) in the setting of
ergot alkaloid use (typically for migraines)~

Treatment:~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Volume expansion and IV heparin as anticoagulation~
\item
  IV infusion of nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, ilioprost or
  combination
\item
  Infusion of Ca 2+ channel blockers~

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Smoking history, onset before 50 years, infrapopliteal arterial
  occlusions, upper limb involvement, absence of atherosclerotic risk
  factors besides smoking
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is important about diagnosing Buerger's}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Typically a diagnosis of exclusion
\item
  Must rule out proximal embolic source, trauma, local lesions (eg pop
  entrapment or cystic adventitial disease), autoimmune disease,
  hypercoagulable status, atherosclerosis
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What physical exam and non-invasive/invasive imaging findings of
Buerger's?}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the mainstay treatment in Buerger's disease?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item

  amputation risk if achieved before onset of gangrene or tissue loss.
  Important to remember following treatments will likely fail without
  smoking cessation.~
\item
  If smoking cessation does not improve, medical management with
  antiplatelet agents, immunomodulators, vasodilators, anticoagulants~
\item
  Endovascular-distal small vessel intervention
\item
  Surgical-upper extremity autogenous vein bypass-limited success due
  to poor outflow~

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{How should patients be monitored with active large artery
vasculitis?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Lab data tracked at least monthly for 6 months with close follow-up
  to ensure appropriate response to medical treatment and enable
  physicians to assess for adverse effects of medical treatment
\item
  Repeat tests after remission reached and imaging choice to evaluate
  large vessels (DUS/CTA/MRA)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the medical treatment for GCA and when do you consider
surgical treatment?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Medical-steroid therapy. In as many as 50\% of patients who have a
  large vessel vasculitis refractory to glucocorticoid therapy alone,
  patients will trial immunomodulators or cytotoxic truxs (ie
  methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, tocilizumab, or
  leflunomide)~
\item
  Intervention-once remission, treatment of symptomatic arterial
  lesions should be considered and as many as 50-70\% with large vessel
  vasculitis will require intervention.~

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Endovascular-angioplasty/stent/stent graft for large vessel
    vasculitis have all been described, however higher restenosis in
    endovascular compared to open treatment
  \item
    Open Surgery (gold standard)-lesions are long, fibrotic and
    therefore less amenable to endovascular treatment. Bypass grafts
    from aorta-CCA are the most common (CEA should be avoid due to
    pathology involved)

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Upper extremity bypass with autogenous vein to the brachial
      artery
    \item
      Aortic aneurysms should be managed with open surgery~

\textbf{How are subclavian aneurysms caused and how can they present?}
\citet{baig84UpperExtremity2019}

Etiology/Pathology:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Degenerative (atherosclerotic or due to aberrant right subclavian
  with degenerative changes in proximal subclavian known as ``Kommerell
  diverticulum'')
\item
  Traumatic (blunt, penetrating, iatrogenic with attempted catheter
  placement)~
\item
  Thoracic outlet obstruction
\end{itemize}

Presentation

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Exam-pulsatile supraclavicular mass or bruit, absent/diminished
  pulses, signs of microembolization (``blue finger'')
\item
  Most discovered incidentally, however referred chest, neck, shoulder
  pain, upper extremity ischemia due to thromboembolic phenomenon,
  brachial plexus compression, hoarseness from right recurrent
  laryngeal nerve compression
\item
  Dysphagia from esophageal compression in aberrant right subclavian
  artery
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are diagnostic studies and treatment modalities for subclavian
aneurysms?}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  CXR-mediastinal mass may suggest neoplasm
\item
  MRA/CTA important to delineate extent of aneurysm and proximity to
  ipsilateral vertebral artery~
\end{itemize}

Treatment:~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Open Repair-resection/endoaneurysmorrhaphy with end to end (small
  aneurysms) or interposition prosthetic graft~

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Proximal-median sternotomy with supraclavicular fossa extension
    for adequate proximal control for right side, however
    supraclavicular with left anterolateral thoracotomy for left
    subclavian aneurysm~
  \item
    Mid-Distal-supraclavicular/infraclavicular generally adequate
    for control where again resection of the clavicle may be needed~
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Endovascular Repair-transbrachial/transfemoral approach with covered
  stent~

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Must consider vertebral artery origin. Can cover vertebral
    artery if contralateral vertebral artery is patent and of
    adequate size, however posterior circulation stroke may occur
    when the contralateral vertebral artery is highly stenotic,
    hypoplastic or occluded.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Hybrid Repair-embolization/coils of proximal subclavian artery
  combined with subclavian transposition or carotid-subclavian bypass
\item
  For aberrant subclavian artery aneurysm, resection or exclusion of
  the aneurysmal artery with vascular reconstruction of the subclavian
  artery is recommended. Especially in the setting of dysphagia
  lusoria, subclavian artery reconstructed by interposition graft
  where proximal anastomosis is on ascending aorta. Alternatively,
  left posterolateral thoracotomy for proximal aneurysm resection and
  right supraclavicular incision for reconstruction of subclavian
  artery by end to side to the right CCA has been reported.

Treatment:~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Open Repair-resection with interposition vein grafting or prosthetic
  if inadequate vein is present.~
\item
  Endovascular repair-covered stent graft can be placed with
  occasional embolization with micro coils to isolate sac and prevent
  retrograde endoleaks
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How are brachial aneurysms caused and how can they present?}

Etiology/Pathology:~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  False aneurysms secondary to repetitive trauma

\item
  Exam: pulsatile mass~
\item
  Local pain or symptoms of median nerve compressions
\item
  Hand/digital ischemia from thrombosis/distal embolization
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are diagnostic studies and treatment modalities for brachial
aneurysms?}

Diagnosis:~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Duplex Ultrasound
\item
  CTA/MRA of upper extremity may be needed to delineate extent of
  aneurysm~
\end{itemize}

Treatment:~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Open Repair (preferred)-resection with patch or interposition vein
  grafting~~
\item
  Endovascular repair-rare and generally in a traumatic setting
\item
  Iatrogenic injuries-due to access and nonoperative treatment for
  small/asymptomatic pseudoaneurysms that are likely to thrombose
  spontaneously. Direct suture repair with evacuation of hematoma is
  possible. Thrombin injection is less favorable due to location and
  short neck.~

\hypertarget{hypothenar-hammer-syndrome}{%
\subsection{Hypothenar hammer syndrome}\label{hypothenar-hammer-syndrome}}

Etiology:~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Repetitive use of palm of hand in activities that involve pushing,
  pounding, twisting
\item
  Name comes from reports of mechanics, factory workers, carpenters or
  laborers who habitually use there hands as a hammer are ad risk for
  disease~
\item
  Repetitive trauma leads to thrombotic occlusion, aneurysm formation
  or both
\end{itemize}

Presentation:~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Asymmetrical distribution involving dominant upper extremity where
  cyanosis and pallor can occur and digits affected are ulnar
  distribution in nature~
\item
  Cool/mottled digits or severe cases with ischemic ulcers
\end{itemize}

Diagnosis:~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Duplex ultrasound~
\item
  CTA or MRA~
\item
  Arteriography (gold standard) with corkscrew pattern typically in
  affected vessels
\end{itemize}

Treatment~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Conservative-smoking cessation/hand protection/cold avoidance~
\item
  Medical-calcium channel blockers/antiplatelet
\item
  Surgical (severe digital ischemia/aneurysm)-ligation if adequate
  collateral or interposition vein graft
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{environmental-exposures}{%
\subsection{Environmental Exposures}\label{environmental-exposures}}

\textbf{Exposure to what environmental agents can result in upper extremity
ischemia?}

Acrosteolysis

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Exposure to polyvinyl chloride can result in ischemic hand symptoms
  similar to those of Raynaud syndrome~
\item
  Angiography-damage to digital arteries with multiple
  stenosis/occlusions or hyper vascularity adjacent to areas of bone
  resorption~
\item
  Treatment-supportive
\end{itemize}

Electrical burns

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textless1000 V cause injuries limited to immediate skin/soft tissue,
  however \textgreater1000 V cause damage from entry to exit point~
\item
  Results in arterial necrosis with thrombus or bleeding and gangrene
  of digits develop~
\item
  Initially can be occlusion/thrombosis or spasm, however later damage
  can cause aneurysmal degeneration~
\item
  Treatment-dependent on soft tissue/bone injuries as well. Can have
  reconstruction with free flap due to local vascular damage or
  occlusion of major artery requiring bypass grafting
\end{itemize}

Extreme thermal injuries

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Workers at risk with chronic exposure to cold (slaughterhouse,
  canning factory, and fisheries)
\item
  Raynaud syndrome symptoms due to vasomotor disturbances in the hands
  when exposed to extreme chronic thermal trauma
\item
  Treatment-Supportive~

\textbf{How can athletes specifically be affected by upper extremity
ischemia?}

Overview

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Athletes who engage in strenuous or exaggerated hand/shoulder
  activity may be susceptible to upper extremity ischemia from
  arterial injury manifested by Raynaud syndrome, symptoms of sudden
  arterial occlusion or digital embolization
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{compression-syndromes}{%
\section{Compression Syndromes}\label{compression-syndromes}}

\textbf{The} \textbf{main syndromes are quadrilateral space syndrome and humeral
compression of the axillary artery. What important information here do
our listeners need to know?}

\hypertarget{quadrilateral-space-syndrome}{%
\subsection{Quadrilateral space syndrome}\label{quadrilateral-space-syndrome}}

Anatomy:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Bordered by teres minor superiorly, humeral shaft laterally, and
  teres major inferiorly, and long head of triceps muscle medially
\item
  Posterior humeral circumflex artery and axillary nerve in space
\end{itemize}

Pathophysiology

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Compression of posterior humeral circumflex occurs with
  abduction/external rotation~
\item
  Typically seen with chronic overhand motion athletes
  (pitchers/volleyball players)
\item
  Vascular-repetitive mechanical trauma to posterior circumflex
  humeral artery~
\item
  Neurogenic-fixed structural impaction of quadrilateral space by
  fibrous bands or space-occupying lesions
\end{itemize}

Presentation

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Muscle atrophy, paresthesias, poorly localized shoulder pain and
  pain in quadrilateral space
\end{itemize}

Treatment

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Medical: Oral anti-inflammatory medications, PT, limitation of
  activities
\item
  Surgery: decompression with neurolysis/excision of fibrous bands or
  other space occupying lesions~
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{humeral-head-compression-of-axillary-artery}{%
\subsection{Humeral head compression of axillary artery}\label{humeral-head-compression-of-axillary-artery}}

Anatomy:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  3rd portion of axillary artery compressed by head of humerus
\end{itemize}

Etiology/Pathophysiology:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Arm is abducted and externally rotated with downward compression of
  humeral head to axillary artery
\end{itemize}

Presentation:

\begin{itemize}

  cutaneous embolization
\end{itemize}

Diagnosis:

\begin{itemize}
\item

  on ultrasonography
\item
  Arteriography with rest and provocative position
\end{itemize}

Treatment:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Supportive with avoidance of throwing motion
\item
  Surgical-saphenous vein patch for no improvement or structural
  injury may require resection with saphenous vein bypass anatomically
  or extra-anatomic tunneling above pec minor

\hypertarget{vascular-trauma-upper-extremity}{%
\section{Vascular Trauma-Upper Extremity}\label{vascular-trauma-upper-extremity}}

\textbf{This is discussed in detail here:} \ref{vascular-trauma}, \textbf{so we
will go over some important specifics for upper extremity vascular
injury.} \citet{kauvar184VascularTrauma2020}

\textbf{What is the mechanism and management of upper extremity axillary
artery trauma?}

Mechanism and Pattern

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Predominantly in penetrating trauma with equal incidence in
  proximal/middle/distal divisions and brachial plexus injury
  in \textgreater1/3rd of arterial injury
\end{itemize}

Diagnostic Considerations

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Physical exam with deficiencies in upper extremity pulses/ischemic
  changes, but may not be present given collateral flow from axillary
  artery to upper extremity~
\item
  High index of suspicion with location of injury proximity to course
  of axillary artery
\item
  Upper extremity Doppler or CTA if patient is stable for diagnosis
\end{itemize}

Surgical Considerations~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Primary repair or treated with interposition graft~
\item
  If hemodynamically stable, can consider covered stent based on
  location to thoracic outlet via femoral/brachial approach
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the mechanism and management of upper extremity brachial
artery trauma?}

Mechanism and Pattern

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Frequently associated with humerus fractures/elbow dislocation
\item
  Penetrating trauma
\end{itemize}

Diagnostic Considerations

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Pulse deficit in majority (\textgreater75\% of cases)
\item
  Upper extremity Doppler of CTA
\end{itemize}

Surgical Considerations~

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Given course, can be extensively mobilized and repaired in
  end-to-end fashion in 50\% of cases. Otherwise, treatment with an
  interposition graft
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the mechanism and management of upper extremity radial/ulnar
artery trauma?}

Mechanism and Pattern

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Associated with significant soft tissue pattern
\end{itemize}

Diagnostic Considerations

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Pulse deficit in \textgreater80\% of patients~
\item
  Doppler based Allen test-confirm radial/ulnar contribution to palmar
  arch
\end{itemize}

Surgical Considerations~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If Allen test reveals a patent palmar arch, the injured artery can
  be ligated~
\item
  If palmar arch is not patent in the absence of contribution of the
  injured artery, it should be repaired
\item
  If both are damaged, preference to ulnar artery as dominant
  contribution to hand~
\item
  Generally, repair can be done in an end to end fashion given
  mobility of the vessel
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{operationsprocedures}{%
\section{Operations/Procedures}\label{operationsprocedures}}

\textbf{What are some indications for carotid-subclavian bypass?}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Atherosclerosis~
\item
  Staged revascularization prior to TEVAR for aneurysmal disease
  requiring coverage of the LSA
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{How does the exposure differentiate in transposition vs bypass?}

Exposure (Transposition vs Bypass)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Arterial transposition via a short, transverse cervical incision
  above the clavicle between two heads of SCM (bypass is lateral to
  entire SCM)
\item
  Sub-platysmal flaps created and avoid EJ vein damage
\item
  Omohypoid divided between heads of SCM and IJ mobilized laterally
  (bypass IJ is mobilized medially to expose CCA and care must be
  taken to avoid phrenic nerve in more lateral approach)
\item
  CCA is reflected medially with vagus nerve~
\item
  On the left side, the thoracic duct is identifiable and divided
  followed by dividing the vertebral vein
\item
  Subclavian artery and proximal branches identified (anterior scalene
  is in lateral dissection)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are some common complications after carotid subclavian bypass in
order of highest to lowest incidence?}

Complications \citet{voigtOutcomesCarotidsubclavianBypass2019}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Phrenic nerve palsy~~
\item
  Recurrent laryngeal palsy~~
\item
  Lymphatic leak~~
\item
  Neck hematoma~~
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{When carotid-subclavian bypass compared to transposition?}~~

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Vertebral artery takes origin from the subclavian artery in a very
  proximal position, then Bypass
\item
  For coronary-subclavian steal with patent internal mammary artery to
  coronary artery bypass graft, then Bypass (a carotid-subclavian
  transposition requires a more proximal clamp with occlusion of
  inline antegrade flow to the coronary bypass during the procedure)
\end{enumerate}
