Frequent repetitive neurological attacks without complete resolution of the deficit between the episodes, producing the same deficit but no progressive deterioration in neurological function If a progressive deterioration then it is a stroke in evolution. Who needs to be screened? Only 15% of stroke victims have a warning TIA before a stroke so waiting until symptoms occur is not ideal. The purpose of carotid bifurcation imaging is to detect “stroke-prone” carotid bifurcation plaque and identify a high-risk patient likely to benefit from therapy designed to reduce stroke risk. The absence of a neck bruit does not exclude the possibility of a significant carotid bifurcation lesion - focal ipsilateral carotid bruits in symptomatic patients has a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 61% for high-grade carotid stenosis (range, 70%-99%). Screening of the general population is not indicated. Screening should be considered for patients with: Evidence of clinically significant peripheral vascular disease regardless of age Patients aged &gt;65 years with a history of one or more of the following atherosclerotic risk factors: CAD Smoking Hypercholesterolemia In general, the more risk factors present, the higher the yield of screening should be expected. The benefit of prophylactic treatment of high grade stenosis is estimated at a 1-2% stroke reduction risk per year.2 Keep in mind that intervention (CEA/CAS) has only demonstrated a benefit in asymptomatic patient with life expectancy greater than 3 years.3–5 US findings that confirm disease 50-69% stenosis of ICA - Low sensitivity for 50-69% stenosis - a negative ultrasound in symptomatic patients necessitates additional imaging PSV 125-229 cm/sec EDV 40-100 Internal/Common Carotid PSV Ratio 2-4 70-99% stenosis of ICA PSV &gt;/= 230 cm/sec EDV &gt;100 (EDV &gt; 140 cm/sec most sensitive for stenosis &gt;80%) Internal/Common Carotid PSV Ratio &gt; 4 Velocity-based estimation of carotid artery stenosis may need to be adjusted in certain circumstances Higher velocities in women than in men Higher velocities in the presence of contralateral carotid artery occlusion. High carotid bifurcation, severe arterial tortuosity, extensive vascular calcification, and obesity may also reduce the accuracy of DUS imaging Other Imaging Modalities CTA Pro - fast, sub-millimeter spatial resolution, visualize surrounding structures Con - cost, contrast exposure MRA Pro - no contrast administered; analyze plaque morphology Con - Does not visualize calcium in plaque; overestimates the degree of stenosis (False positive for 50-69% to be read as &gt;70%) Catheter-based digital subtraction imaging (DSA) Still considered by many the gold-standard imaging modality Reserved for individuals with conflicting less-invasive imaging or those considered for CAS Con - cost and risk of stroke 2.3 Management 2.3.1 Optimal medical therapy Hypertension Lowering blood pressure to a target &lt;140/90 mmHg by lifestyle interventions and anti-hypertensive treatment is recommended in individuals who have hypertension with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis or those with TIA or stroke after the hyper-acute period. Each 10-mm Hg reduction in blood pressure among hypertensive patients decreases the risk for stroke by 33%. Diabetes Glucose control to nearly normoglycemic levels (target hemoglobin A1C &lt;7%) is recommended among diabetic patients to reduce microvascular complications and, with lesser certainty, macrovascular complications other than stroke. Lipid abnormalities Risk of stroke decreased by &gt;15% for every 10% reduction in serum LDL in patients with known coronary or other atherosclerosis Statin agents are recommended targeting LDL of 100 mg/dL, for those with coronary heart disease or symptomatic atherosclerotic disease, and LDL of 70 mg/dL for very high-risk persons with multiple risk factors High dose statin therapy in patients with TIA/stroke reduce future rates of stroke or cardiovascular events but not overall mortality at 5 years.6 Smoking - Physician counseling is an important and effective intervention that reduces smoking in patients by 10% to 20% Antithrombotic therapy - There is no evidence to suggest that antiplatelet agents other than aspirin have improved benefit in asymptomatic patients with carotid atherosclerosis 2.3.2 Carotid endarterectomy Timing Recommendations on when to operate after a stroke Acute stroke with a fixed neurologic deficit of &gt;6h duration - When the patient is medically stable, treatment in less than or equal to 2 weeks after the stroke is preferable.7,8 Consider urgent intervention in a medically stable patient with mild-moderate neurologic deficit, if there is a significant area of ischemic penumbra at risk for progression Stroke in evolution (fluctuating / evolving neuro deficit) or crescendo TIA (repetitive transient ischemia w improvement between events) - If neuro status is not stabilized by medical intervention consider urgent CEA CEA is preferred to CAS based on an increased embolic potential of carotid lesions that present in this fashion.9 Management of acute stroke10 &lt;4.5hrs from onset of symptoms - tPA unless contraindication Age &gt;80 and diabetes are contraindication to tPA after 3hrs. Other contraindications - high BP, intracranial hemorrhage, recent stroke or head trauma, spine/brain surgery within 3mo, GI bleed within 21d &lt;6hr from onset of symptoms - catheter directed therapy What is the only emergent indication for CEA? Crescendo TIAs or a stroke in evolution with a surgically correctable lesion that is identified Intraoperative Techniques General concepts Patch angioplasty or eversion endarterectomy are recommended rather than primary closure to reduce the early and late complications of CEA (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A). Neuromonitoring/Shunting options during a carotid endarterectomy Local anesthesia with direct neuro monitoring - the patient is awake and moving to command throughout the case. Though improved neuromonitoring has not been shown to reduce MI rate with CEA Stump pressure Clamp the inflow and place butterfly attached to a-line tubing into the internal carotid If stump pressure is &gt; 40 mmHg can proceed, if &lt; 40 place shunt EEG Neuromonitoring - EEG tech places neuromonitoring, monitored by intraop tech and neurologist remotely, generally clamp ICA for 3 minutes before proceeding, if any deficits unclamp, await normalization of EEG then proceed Non-selective shunting - shunt all carotids Techniques to reach internal carotid lesions that are high? Nasotracheal intubation will help extend the neck to reach higher lesions Divide posterior belly of digastric to reach high lesions with care to watch for glossopharyngeal Styloidectomy Mandible subluxation with assistance from ENT if previous techniques fail. What is the best technique for a patient with a kinked internal carotid artery? Eversion carotid endarterectomy will allow you to reduce the redundancy Otherwise, no advantage has been shown between eversion or patch, both can be shunted Discuss nerve injuries – where you would encounter these and what deficit would be seen Hypoglossal Just above the bifurcation of the carotid artery Will see tongue deviation to the side of injury Glossopharyngeal High dissections under digastric Difficulty swallowing, aspiration risk, can be devastating Vagus Adjacent and lateral to carotid, injury occurs with carotid clamping, Hoarseness is noted as RLN is a branch off of vagus Marginal Mandibular (Off of facial nerve) Retraction at the angle of the jaw for high dissections Leads to the corner of lip drooping, can be confused with a neuro deficit following the case Postoperative Complications What to do if neuro deficits following your carotid endarterectomy If in OR – perform duplex, if normal open wound and shoot cerebral angiogram If in Recovery or on the floor – many would consider CTA first vs duplex to look for thrombosis Risk factors and how to manage hyperperfusion syndrome? Defined as an ipsilateral headache, hypertension, seizures, and focal neurological deficits can present 2-3 days out from surgery Patients with uncontrolled hypertension are at risk for hyperperfusion syndrome, clinical practice guidelines by SVS recommend strict BP control following CEA, maintain a pressure less than 140/80 High risk groups ESRD patients have higher rates of perioperative stroke, but also have higher rates of stroke if not revascularized.11 Long term complications and follow up Recommend f/u US at &lt;/=30 days. &gt;/= 50% stenosis requires further imaging. Contralateral stenosis The risk of progression for moderate stenosis at the initial surveillance to severe stenosis can be as high as five times Requires post-operative surveillance. 2.3.3 Carotid Artery Stenting In patients aged &gt;70 undergoing CAS the risk of stroke was the highest, presumably due to calcific disease in the arch Lesion-specific characteristics are thought to increase the risk of cerebral vascular events after CAS and include a “soft” lipid-rich plaque identified on noninvasive imaging, extensive (15 mm or more) disease, a pre-occlusive lesion, and circumferential heavy calcification This can be reduced, but not eliminated, by using flow-reversal embolic protection rather than distal filter protection Limited data on CAS in asymptomatic patients - currently is not supported by guidelines or considered reimbursable Consider CAS in symptomatic patients with &gt;50% stenosis who are poor candidates for CEA due to severe uncorrectable medical comorbidities and/or anatomic considerations Ipsilateral neck dissection or XRT - equivalent periprocedural stroke rate to CEA, but increased later stroke rate. CEA higher rates of cranial nerve damage (9%).12 Contralateral vocal cord paralysis Lesions that extend proximally to the clavicle or distal to C2 Transfemoral Approach vs Transcarotid approach ROADSTER Trial - single arm study with flow reversal for cerebral protection. Suggest lower rates of post-op stroke Post-op follow up - Dual-platelet therapy should be continued for 1 month after the procedure, and aspirin should be continued indefinitely In stent restenosis (&gt;50%) - repeat angioplasty or stent have low incidence of periprocedural stroke but failed to improve long term stroke/death/MI or patency rates.13 2.3.4 Management of uncommon disease presentations Occluded Carotid What to do for occluded carotid? Leave it alone What if occluded carotid is still causing TIAs? External carotid endarterectomy and ligation of internal The addition of oral anticoagulation is likely to reduce the rate of recurrent CVA What if the patient has severe vertebrobasilar insufficiency and carotid artery disease? Should undergo carotid revascularization first to improve flow Vertebrobasilar insufficiency characterized by dizziness, ataxia, nausea, vertigo and bilateral weakness.14 What about tandem lesions in the carotid in a symptomatic patient, carotid bulb and carotid siphon lesion (high ICA)? How should you treat this? Treat carotid bulb first, likely the embolic source Carotid artery dissection Patients with carotid dissection should be initially treated with antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet agents or anticoagulation) (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence C). Indications for endovascular treatment of carotid artery dissection15–17 Ongoing symptoms on best medical therapy Contraindication to antithrombotics Pseudoaneurysm Simultaneous coronary and carotid disease Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis will benefit from CEA before or concomitant with CABG. The timing of the intervention depends on the clinical presentation and institutional experience (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B). Patients with severe bilateral asymptomatic carotid stenosis, including stenosis and contralateral occlusion, should be considered for CEA before or concomitant with CABG (GRADE 2, Level of Evidence B) Patients undergoing simultaneous CEA/CABG demonstrate highest mortality.18 2.4 Prospective Trials - MUST READS Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) Compared medical management with CEA in asymptomatic patients with &gt; 60% stenosis 5-year stroke and death rate was 5.1% vs 11% In women, the benefit of CEA was not as certain as 5y stroke and death rates were 7.3% vs. 8.7% This was pre statin and clopidogrel era North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET)19 Compared medical management vs CEA for symptomatic patients with moderate (50-69%) and severe stenosis (&gt;70%) Only moderate impact for patients with moderate stenosis (50-69%) Symptomatic patients with &gt;70 % stenosis benefited from CEA, at 18 months 7% major stroke in surgical arm, and a 24% stroke rate in medical arm. 29% reduction in 5-year risk of stroke or death Patients with severe &gt;70% stenosis had such a dramatic effect the trial was stopped early for this subset and all referred for endarterectomy No benefit is shown in symptomatic patients with &lt; 50% stenosis European studies have shown similar results ACST = ACAS ECST = NASCET. Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST) Compared CEA vs. CAS in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Composite endpoint of 30-day stroke, MI, death equivalent between CEA and CAS CAS had a significantly higher incidence of stroke and death than CEA and CEA higher incidence of MI Follow up at 10 years demonstrated no difference in composite stroke/MI/death but increased rate of stroke/death in stented patients likely attributable to increased periprocedural stroke.20 Subanalyses identified that older patients (&gt;70y) had better outcomes after CEA than CAS, the QOL impact of stroke was more significant than that of MI, and anatomic characteristics of carotid lesions (longer, sequential, remote) were predictive of increased stroke and death after CAS Unfortunately, this study provides a benchmark to strive for, but no other large trials have achieved these results. ROADSTER Single arm feasibility trial of transcarotid carotid stenting The results of the ROADSTER trial demonstrate that the use of the ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS is safe and effective at preventing stroke during CAS. The overall stroke rate of 1.4% is the lowest reported to date for any prospective, multicenter clinical trial of CAS. Trials to look out for in the next few years CREST-2 - multicenter, randomized controlled trial is underway that is evaluating revascularization against modern intensive medical management ACT-1 and ACST-2- the role of intervention in asymptomatic patients, designed to compare the early and long-term results of CEA vs CAS and best medical management ROADSTER-2 - TCAR References "],["upper-extremity.html", "Chapter 3 Upper Extremity 3.1 Anatomy/ Exposure of Vessels 3.2 Epidemiology, etiology, and diagnostic evaluation 3.3 Vaso-occlusive disease 3.4 Vasospastic Disorders 3.5 Aneurysmal Disease 3.6 Occupational Vascular Disease 3.7 Compression Syndromes 3.8 Vascular Trauma-Upper Extremity 3.9 Operations/Procedures", " Chapter 3 Upper Extremity 21 Jan 2021: Kush Sharma, MD and Ashraf Mansour, MD Your browser does not support the audio tag; for browser support, please see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 3.1 Anatomy/ Exposure of Vessels What are the zones of the upper extremity?21 Division of the upper extremity into three zones: Intrathoracic zone including aortic arch, innominate artery, subclavian artery bilaterally, innominate veins, and SVC Thoracic outlet (base of neck to the axilla including the subclavian, proximal vertebral, proximal axillary arteries/veins) Axilla to fingers (the arm) What are some common exposures for major upper extremity arteries? Right Subclavian Artery: Medial sternotomy (proximal) or right supraclavicular area (mid/distal) Left Subclavian Artery: Anterolateral thoracotomy in emergent setting for proximal left subclavian artery control. When third space sternotomy, supraclavicular incision with thoracotomy “trap door” exposure Supraclavicular incision: After division of the platysma and clavicular head of the SCM, fat pat of varying thickness contains the omohyoid muscle. This should be divided and placed superiorly/laterally. At this point, the anterior scalene muscle is exposed medially with phrenic nerve running in lateral to medial direction. Division of anterior scalene for carotid/subclavian bypass should be performed as close to the first rib as possible. After this is performed, the subclavian artery is exposed. Axillary Artery: Infraclavicular exposure below middle 1/3rd of clavicle. Pec major split and pec minor freed at lateral wound. Axillary vein followed by deep and superior to get to artery Anatomically bound by the first rib proximally and the lateral edge of the teres major muscle distally. For exposure of the first part of the axillary artery, the ipsilateral arm is abducted approximately 90 degrees and horizontal skin incision 2 cm below the middle third of the clavicle. Underlying pec major is split by bluntly separating the fibers and followed by exposing the tough clavipectoral fascia. At the lateral wound, the pec minor can be freed and laterally retracted. The axillary vein is first structure encountered in the sheath and the artery lies just superior and deep to the vein. Make sure to avoid nerves of brachial plexus that lie deep to first part of axillary artery and are at risk for injury during blind placement of occluding arterial clamps.22 What steps are involved for brachial artery exposure? Brachial artery: incision between biceps/triceps on medial arm (avoid basilic vein damage in subcutaneous and deep to the fasia at medial biceps. Median nerve seen and retracted. Two brachial vein are paired adjacent to artery. Superficial location makes it vulnerable to injury and accounts for most vascular injuries of upper extremities. Brachial artery exposure involves a 5-8 cm longitudinal incision in the groove between the biceps/triceps muscles on the medial aspect of the arm. In the lower half of the arm, take care to avoid basilic vein damage in the subcutaneous tissue. Neurovascular bundle exposed by incising the deep fascia at the medial border of the biceps muscle, which is retracted anteriorly. After retracting basilic vein into posterior wound ,brachial sheath is opened and median nerve is most superficial structure and retracted. The artery lies deep to the nerve and surrounded by two brachial veins. Posteriorly, is the presence of the ulnar nerve. Brachial Artery bifurcates at the radial tuberosity into radial/ulnar branches. After the bifurcation and immediately after its origin, the ulnar artery gives off a short common interosseous branch, which bifurcates at the hiatus in the proximal interosseous membrane. Exposure of brachial artery in the antecubital fossa requires a transverse skin incision 1 cm distal to the midpoint of the antecubital crease. After deepening, avoid injury to subcutaneous veins and mobilize the basilic vein medially. Medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve should be protected. Divide the bicipital aponeurosis and after division, exposure of the brachial artery is present, which is flanked by two deep veins and crossing branches. Isolation of brachial artery requires ligation and division of these crossing vein branches. Radial artery at the wrist with 2-3 cm longitudinal incision generally between radial artery and cephalic vein. Radial artery was exposed by incising the antebrachial fascia just medial to the radius. Two veins accompany the artery and should be dissected away during arterial isolation. The superficial radial nerve and its medial/lateral branches course between the cephalic vein and radial artery in the area. Exposure of the ulnar artery is by coursing beneath the superficial flexor muscles in the proximal forearm, emerging near the ulnar border at the point midway between the elbow and the wrist. In the distal forearm, the ulnar artery course just beneath the antebrachial fascia and is easily exposed through a longitudinal incision placed radial to the flexor carbi ulnaris. The palmar branch of the ulnar nerve courses the superficial to the antebrachial fascia and should be preserved during arterial exposure What common aberrant upper extremity/arch anatomy is important to be aware of? Bovine arch with left common carotid/left subclavian have common origin Vertebral artery directly off the aortic arch Aberrant right subclavian where innominate becomes right CCA and right subclavian distal to last branch on left side passing behind esophagus to supply the right arm 3.2 Epidemiology, etiology, and diagnostic evaluation How does evaluation of upper extremity ischemia differentiate from lower extremity ischemia?23 Upper extremity ischemia &lt;5% of patients with limb ischemia and in contrast to lower extremity, atherosclerosis is not a major contributor to upper extremity ischemia Vast majority of cases caused by autoimmune/connective tissue disorders How can upper extremity disease be classified? Anatomic Location: Large vs. Small Vessel Disease Process: Vasospastic or occlusive. Vasospastic disease is more responsive to pharmacologic management while occlusive requiring endovascular/surgical management. How should patients be evaluated who have concern for upper extremity disease? Diagnostic Evaluation Detailed H+P evaluation (pulse palpation, auscultation at supraclavicular/infraclavicular fossa may reaveal a bruit concerning for subclavian artery stenosis, upper extremity neurovascular/skin exam) Brachial/forearm blood pressures and if suspected claudication, measured at rest and 2-5 minutes after exercise. Look for a gradient of &gt;20 mmHg is considered significant Some or all of 6 P’s of acute limb ischemia with symptoms occurring within 14 days are deemed acute Doppler insonation of radial, ulnar, palmar, and digital arteries Vascular Lab Evaluation Segmental Pressure Measurements Duplex Ultrasound (look for large vessel occlusive disease) Other Imaging CTA/MRA Clinical Lab tests Inflammatory disorders-CBC, ESR, ANA, RF Hypercoagulable screening 3.3 Vaso-occlusive disease What are causes and symptoms associated with subclavian/axillary occlusive disease?24 Etiology: Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of subclavian/axillary occlusive disease. Left SCA &gt; Right involvement. Less common causes include Takayasu disease, giant cell arteritis, or arterial TOS Symptoms: Upper extremity arm/hand ischemia or neurologic symptoms due to subclavian-vertebral steal. Because significant collaterals, minimal pain on exertion even with subclavian occlusion What are causes and symptoms associated with brachial/forearm occlusive disease? Etiology: MCC of brachial artery occlusion is cardiac origin embolus. Atherosclerosis RARELY affects the brachial artery. Distal axillary/proximal brachial stenosis can be from repetitive trauma from crutch use.  Forearm occlusive disease can be seen in advanced ESRD/DM where calcific atherosclerosis of radial/ulnar arteries is present. Less common causes include Beurger disease or Raynaud Phenomenon  How/when is upper extremity occlusive disease treated? SCA Occlusive Disease Endovascular: treated with stenting if they are short segment and not close to the vertebral artery origin. Balloon expandable stents favorable for ostial lesions and access can be via the femoral or ipsilateral brachial artery  Surgery: Bypass from aortic arch through median sternotomy  Ipsilateral CCA to subclavian artery (bypass or transposition)  Contralateral CCA (anterior or retropharyngeal) Brachial/forearm Occlusive disease  Endovascular: PTA evidence is anecdotal with stents for lesions unresponsive to PTA or dissection following angioplasty  Surgery:  GSV vein bypass remains standard for revascularization with bypasses to superficial or deep palmar arch have good patency rates. Tunneling is subcutaneous if to distal ulnar or superficial palmar arch whereas anatomical to distal radial artery over the anatomic snuffbox  3.4 Vasospastic Disorders What is Raynaud’s and what causes it?23,25 Exaggeration of normal physiologic response with episodic pallor or cyanosis of the fingers caused by small digital artery vasoconstriction occurring in response to cold or emotional stress. There is an abnormality with sympathetic nervous system, resulting in a multifactorial problem involving a combination of vascular, neural, and humoral factors. What are the subtypes of Raynaud’s phenomenon and what is the underlying pathology? Primary: Raynaud’s disease-idiopathic form that is a benign process not associated with structural vascular change. Triggers include (cold, emotional stress, caffeine) resulting in digital smooth muscle contraction and temporary digital hypoperfusion. Secondary: Fixed vascular obstruction to blood flow decreasing threshold for cold induced vasospasm or progress to tissue loss. Diseases associated include mixed connective tissue disease, SLE, and rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma (accounts for 80-90% of cases). In setting of lower digital blood pressure, symptomatic digital ischemia or tissue loss under low stress conditions. With cold/emotional stress, vasoconstrictive response of digital artery smooth muscle further causes arterial closure and resultant symptoms What are diagnostic criteria for Raynaud’s? Clinical (Progression of ischemia with white -&gt; blue -&gt; red finger discoloration. Episodes can be self-limited and may last from less than a minute, but generally not longer than 10-20 minutes  Qualitative testing for severity of cold sensitivity in Raynaud’s syndrome can be useful. Most basic test is cold sensitivity and recovery after ice water immersion. &gt;10 minutes return to baseline pressure concerning for Raynaud’s Segmental pressures with finger systolic blood pressure can differentiate purely vasospastic vs occlusive disease. Difference of more than 15 mm Hg between fingers or absolute finger pressure &lt;70 mm Hg may indicate occlusive disease  Serologic evaluation (ANA/RF) What are appropriate treatments for Raynaud’s phenomenon? Medical-cold/tobacco avoidance. Calcium channel blocker (nifedipine) has been the most effective and losartan has also been beneficial. Fluoxetine (SSRI). Other drugs include alpha blocker, sildenafil, reserpine, cilostazol, captopril. NOT GOOD OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH ARTERIAL OBSTRUCTION  Surgical-thoracic sympathectomy (used for treatment of digital artery vasospasm/digital ischemic ulceration). For vasospasm, thoracic sympathetcomy is initially successful, but symptoms return generally within 3-6 months.  Immunosuppression/immunomodulation for connective tissue disorders associated with secondary Raynaud phenomenon 3.4.1 Ergotism What is Ergotism?26 Etiology: Ergot is a parasitic fungal disease that has a particular prevalence for infecting rye plants and ergot alkaloids have been linked to epidemic poisonings that manifested as ergotism from consumption of rye  Modern day is rare What causes Ergotism and how do patients present? Ergotamine is chemically like endogenous catecholamines/indolamines and when applied clinically, it behaves as an agonist to alpha-adrenergic, sertoninergic, and dopaminergic receptors. Despite limited bioavailability, vasocontrictive effects have been reported to last for 24 hours or longer  Gangrenous-mild limb pain followed by burning pain/shooting and  Convulsive-heaviness in limbs and head associated with diarrhea. Could result in tonic-clonic spasms  How can you diagnose Ergotism and what is the process for treating this disease? Upper extremity ischemia (i.e. digital ulceration) in the setting of ergot alkaloid use (typically for migraines)  Treatment:  Volume expansion and IV heparin as anticoagulation  IV infusion of nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, ilioprost or combination Infusion of Ca 2+ channel blockers  Surgical: for thrombosis, consider thrombolysis  3.4.2 Buerger’s Disease How is Buerger’s disease categorized?24 Non-atherosclerotic, segmental, inflammatory disease of small/medium sized arteries in distal extremities of tobacco users distinct from either atherosclerosis of immune arteritis What clinical criteria can help diagnose Buerger’s? Smoking history, onset before 50 years, infrapopliteal arterial occlusions, upper limb involvement, absence of atherosclerotic risk factors besides smoking What is important about diagnosing Buerger’s Typically a diagnosis of exclusion Must rule out proximal embolic source, trauma, local lesions (eg pop entrapment or cystic adventitial disease), autoimmune disease, hypercoagulable status, atherosclerosis What physical exam and non-invasive/invasive imaging findings of Buerger’s? Distal, but not proximal arterial disease (palpable brachial/popliteal but absent/reduced at ankle or wrist) DBI&lt;0.6 and flat/reduced digital waveforms CTA/MRA/DSA-characteristic corkscrew collateral What is the mainstay treatment in Buerger’s disease? Smoking cessation! Only treatment to improve symptoms and reduce amputation risk if achieved before onset of gangrene or tissue loss. Important to remember following treatments will likely fail without smoking cessation.  If smoking cessation does not improve, medical management with antiplatelet agents, immunomodulators, vasodilators, anticoagulants  Endovascular-distal small vessel intervention Surgical-upper extremity autogenous vein bypass-limited success due to poor outflow  Sometimes can consider upper extremity sympathectomy, but unproven benefit  Amputation-reported in 30-40% who are followed longer than 5 years  3.4.3 Large Artery Vasculitis What are common characteristics for patients who are suspected to have a large vessel vasculitis?27 Affect aorta and major branches  Present with non-specific heterogenous symptoms making the diagnosis challenging. Most commonly, they present with systemic or constitutional symptoms (fatigue, fever, weight loss, arthralgias) Frequently, diagnosis made with presence of constitutional symptoms, elevated inflammatory markers, and dedicated imaging (MRA, CTA, DUS, or PET) How can you differentiate takayasu arteritis vs giant cell arteritis? Takayasu arteritis  Aorta and primary  Young patients &lt;20 years and female in 80-90% of cases, Asian populations Criteria (ACR) Onset &lt;40 years Claudication of an extremity  Decreased brachial pulse  &gt;10 mmHg SBP between arms Bruit over subclavian arteries or aorta Arteriographic evidence of narrowing/occlusion in aorta/primary branches/or large upper/lower extremity arteries Giant cell arteritis  Aorta and main branches, but pre-dilection for carotid artery branches Diagnosis:  Age at disease onset &gt; 50 years  New headache Temporal artery abnormality  Elevated ESR (&gt;50)  Abnormal artery biopsy (gold standard test) Other symptoms include jaw pain with mastication or visual changes Associated with Polymyalgia rheumatic, characterized by morning stiffness in shoulders/hips occurring in 40-50% of patients  Arteriography/MRA/CTA/PET may be used to assess large vessel involvement How should patients be monitored with active large artery vasculitis? Lab data tracked at least monthly for 6 months with close follow-up to ensure appropriate response to medical treatment and enable physicians to assess for adverse effects of medical treatment Repeat tests after remission reached and imaging choice to evaluate large vessels (DUS/CTA/MRA) What is the medical treatment for GCA and when do you consider surgical treatment? Medical-steroid therapy. In as many as 50% of patients who have a large vessel vasculitis refractory to glucocorticoid therapy alone, patients will trial immunomodulators or cytotoxic truxs (ie methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, tocilizumab, or leflunomide)  Intervention-once remission, treatment of symptomatic arterial lesions should be considered and as many as 50-70% with large vessel vasculitis will require intervention.  Endovascular-angioplasty/stent/stent graft for large vessel vasculitis have all been described, however higher restenosis in endovascular compared to open treatment Open Surgery (gold standard)-lesions are long, fibrotic and therefore less amenable to endovascular treatment. Bypass grafts from aorta-CCA are the most common (CEA should be avoid due to pathology involved) Upper extremity bypass with autogenous vein to the brachial artery Aortic aneurysms should be managed with open surgery  3.5 Aneurysmal Disease How are subclavian aneurysms caused and how can they present?28 Etiology/Pathology: Degenerative (atherosclerotic or due to aberrant right subclavian with degenerative changes in proximal subclavian known as “Kommerell diverticulum”) Traumatic (blunt, penetrating, iatrogenic with attempted catheter placement)  Thoracic outlet obstruction Presentation Exam-pulsatile supraclavicular mass or bruit, absent/diminished pulses, signs of microembolization (“blue finger”) Most discovered incidentally, however referred chest, neck, shoulder pain, upper extremity ischemia due to thromboembolic phenomenon, brachial plexus compression, hoarseness from right recurrent laryngeal nerve compression Dysphagia from esophageal compression in aberrant right subclavian artery What are diagnostic studies and treatment modalities for subclavian aneurysms? CXR-mediastinal mass may suggest neoplasm MRA/CTA important to delineate extent of aneurysm and proximity to ipsilateral vertebral artery  Treatment:  Open Repair-resection/endoaneurysmorrhaphy with end to end (small aneurysms) or interposition prosthetic graft  Proximal-median sternotomy with supraclavicular fossa extension for adequate proximal control for right side, however supraclavicular with left anterolateral thoracotomy for left subclavian aneurysm  Mid-Distal-supraclavicular/infraclavicular generally adequate for control where again resection of the clavicle may be needed  Endovascular Repair-transbrachial/transfemoral approach with covered stent  Must consider vertebral artery origin. Can cover vertebral artery if contralateral vertebral artery is patent and of adequate size, however posterior circulation stroke may occur when the contralateral vertebral artery is highly stenotic, hypoplastic or occluded. Hybrid Repair-embolization/coils of proximal subclavian artery combined with subclavian transposition or carotid-subclavian bypass For aberrant subclavian artery aneurysm, resection or exclusion of the aneurysmal artery with vascular reconstruction of the subclavian artery is recommended. Especially in the setting of dysphagia lusoria, subclavian artery reconstructed by interposition graft where proximal anastomosis is on ascending aorta. Alternatively, left posterolateral thoracotomy for proximal aneurysm resection and right supraclavicular incision for reconstruction of subclavian artery by end to side to the right CCA has been reported. How are axillary aneurysms caused and how can they present? Etiology/Pathology:  Blunt/penetrating trauma Congenital (infrequently reported) Post-traumatic axillary aneurysms (repeated abduction/external rotation downward toward humeral head in baseball pitchers)  Presentation:  Exam-pulsatile supraclavicular mass or bruit, absent/diminished pulses, signs of microembolization (“blue finger”) What are diagnostic studies and treatment modalities for axillary aneurysms? Diagnosis:  Ultrasound CTA/MRA of upper extremity Treatment:  Open Repair-resection with interposition vein grafting or prosthetic if inadequate vein is present.  Endovascular repair-covered stent graft can be placed with occasional embolization with micro coils to isolate sac and prevent retrograde endoleaks How are brachial aneurysms caused and how can they present? Etiology/Pathology:  False aneurysms secondary to repetitive trauma Iatrogenic complications  IV drug abuse (infected pseudoaneurysms in antecubital fossa)  Connective tissue disorders (ex. type IV Ehlers danlos) Presentation:  Exam: pulsatile mass  Local pain or symptoms of median nerve compressions Hand/digital ischemia from thrombosis/distal embolization What are diagnostic studies and treatment modalities for brachial aneurysms? Diagnosis:  Duplex Ultrasound CTA/MRA of upper extremity may be needed to delineate extent of aneurysm  Treatment:  Open Repair (preferred)-resection with patch or interposition vein grafting   Endovascular repair-rare and generally in a traumatic setting Iatrogenic injuries-due to access and nonoperative treatment for small/asymptomatic pseudoaneurysms that are likely to thrombose spontaneously. Direct suture repair with evacuation of hematoma is possible. Thrombin injection is less favorable due to location and short neck.  3.6 Occupational Vascular Disease There are some occupational vascular disorders than contribute to vascular disease in the upper extremity. Hand arm vibration syndrome and hypothenar hammer are of particular importance. Can you talk to us about the key information from these syndromes?29 3.6.1 Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome  Etiology: Vibrating handheld machines (eg pneumatic hammers and drills, grinders, and chain saws)  Linear relationship between exposure over years and onset of this syndrome  Exact mechanism unknown, but thought that endothelial damage with sympathetic hyperactivity -&gt; finger blanching attack  Presentation: Various stages seen where early results in slight tingling/numbness and lateral, the tips of one or more fingers experience attacks of blanching that is usually precipitated by cold  Blanching typically lasts 1 hour and terminates with reactive hyperemia, but prolonged exposure can cause bluish black cyanosis of fingers  Diagnosis  Detailed history with use of vibrating tools/symptoms of Raynaud phenomenon  Objectively: cold induced ischemia with recording time until digital temperature recovers Digital occlusion with noninvasive digit pressures or duplex scanning Treatment Avoidance of vibratory tools Nifedipine (Ca2+ channel blocker) in advanced cases  IV prostanoid (ie prostacyclin) for digital gangrene  Surgery-cervical sympathetectomy or digital sympathectomy rarely needed 3.6.2 Hypothenar hammer syndrome Etiology:  Repetitive use of palm of hand in activities that involve pushing, pounding, twisting Name comes from reports of mechanics, factory workers, carpenters or laborers who habitually use there hands as a hammer are ad risk for disease  Repetitive trauma leads to thrombotic occlusion, aneurysm formation or both Presentation:  Asymmetrical distribution involving dominant upper extremity where cyanosis and pallor can occur and digits affected are ulnar distribution in nature  Cool/mottled digits or severe cases with ischemic ulcers Diagnosis:  Duplex ultrasound  CTA or MRA  Arteriography (gold standard) with corkscrew pattern typically in affected vessels Treatment  Conservative-smoking cessation/hand protection/cold avoidance  Medical-calcium channel blockers/antiplatelet Surgical (severe digital ischemia/aneurysm)-ligation if adequate collateral or interposition vein graft 3.6.3 Environmental Exposures Exposure to what environmental agents can result in upper extremity ischemia? Acrosteolysis Exposure to polyvinyl chloride can result in ischemic hand symptoms similar to those of Raynaud syndrome  Angiography-damage to digital arteries with multiple stenosis/occlusions or hyper vascularity adjacent to areas of bone resorption  Treatment-supportive Electrical burns &lt;1000 V cause injuries limited to immediate skin/soft tissue, however &gt;1000 V cause damage from entry to exit point  Results in arterial necrosis with thrombus or bleeding and gangrene of digits develop  Initially can be occlusion/thrombosis or spasm, however later damage can cause aneurysmal degeneration  Treatment-dependent on soft tissue/bone injuries as well. Can have reconstruction with free flap due to local vascular damage or occlusion of major artery requiring bypass grafting Extreme thermal injuries Workers at risk with chronic exposure to cold (slaughterhouse, canning factory, and fisheries) Raynaud syndrome symptoms due to vasomotor disturbances in the hands when exposed to extreme chronic thermal trauma Treatment-Supportive  3.6.4 Sports Medicine How can athletes specifically be affected by upper extremity ischemia? Overview Athletes who engage in strenuous or exaggerated hand/shoulder activity may be susceptible to upper extremity ischemia from arterial injury manifested by Raynaud syndrome, symptoms of sudden arterial occlusion or digital embolization 3.7 Compression Syndromes The main syndromes are quadrilateral space syndrome and humeral compression of the axillary artery. What important information here do our listeners need to know? 3.7.1 Quadrilateral space syndrome Anatomy: Bordered by teres minor superiorly, humeral shaft laterally, and teres major inferiorly, and long head of triceps muscle medially Posterior humeral circumflex artery and axillary nerve in space Pathophysiology Compression of posterior humeral circumflex occurs with abduction/external rotation  Typically seen with chronic overhand motion athletes (pitchers/volleyball players) Vascular-repetitive mechanical trauma to posterior circumflex humeral artery  Neurogenic-fixed structural impaction of quadrilateral space by fibrous bands or space-occupying lesions Presentation Muscle atrophy, paresthesias, poorly localized shoulder pain and pain in quadrilateral space Treatment Medical: Oral anti-inflammatory medications, PT, limitation of activities Surgery: decompression with neurolysis/excision of fibrous bands or other space occupying lesions  3.7.2 Humeral head compression of axillary artery Anatomy: 3rd portion of axillary artery compressed by head of humerus Etiology/Pathophysiology: Arm is abducted and externally rotated with downward compression of humeral head to axillary artery Presentation: Arm fatigue, loss of pitch velocity, finger numbness, Raynaud, cutaneous embolization Diagnosis: Provocative maneuvers with impedance of flow through axillary artery on ultrasonography Arteriography with rest and provocative position Treatment: Supportive with avoidance of throwing motion Surgical-saphenous vein patch for no improvement or structural injury may require resection with saphenous vein bypass anatomically or extra-anatomic tunneling above pec minor 3.7.3 Thoracic Outlet Compression Covered in detail here: 4 3.8 Vascular Trauma-Upper Extremity This is discussed in detail here: 11, so we will go over some important specifics for upper extremity vascular injury.30 What is the mechanism and management of upper extremity axillary artery trauma? Mechanism and Pattern Predominantly in penetrating trauma with equal incidence in proximal/middle/distal divisions and brachial plexus injury in &gt;1/3rd of arterial injury Diagnostic Considerations Physical exam with deficiencies in upper extremity pulses/ischemic changes, but may not be present given collateral flow from axillary artery to upper extremity  High index of suspicion with location of injury proximity to course of axillary artery Upper extremity Doppler or CTA if patient is stable for diagnosis Surgical Considerations  Primary repair or treated with interposition graft  If hemodynamically stable, can consider covered stent based on location to thoracic outlet via femoral/brachial approach What is the mechanism and management of upper extremity brachial artery trauma? Mechanism and Pattern Frequently associated with humerus fractures/elbow dislocation Penetrating trauma Diagnostic Considerations Pulse deficit in majority (&gt;75% of cases) Upper extremity Doppler of CTA Surgical Considerations  Given course, can be extensively mobilized and repaired in end-to-end fashion in 50% of cases. Otherwise, treatment with an interposition graft What is the mechanism and management of upper extremity radial/ulnar artery trauma? Mechanism and Pattern Associated with significant soft tissue pattern Diagnostic Considerations Pulse deficit in &gt;80% of patients  Doppler based Allen test-confirm radial/ulnar contribution to palmar arch Surgical Considerations  If Allen test reveals a patent palmar arch, the injured artery can be ligated  If palmar arch is not patent in the absence of contribution of the injured artery, it should be repaired If both are damaged, preference to ulnar artery as dominant contribution to hand  Generally, repair can be done in an end to end fashion given mobility of the vessel 3.9 Operations/Procedures What are some indications for carotid-subclavian bypass? Atherosclerosis  Staged revascularization prior to TEVAR for aneurysmal disease requiring coverage of the LSA How does the exposure differentiate in transposition vs bypass? Exposure (Transposition vs Bypass) Arterial transposition via a short, transverse cervical incision above the clavicle between two heads of SCM (bypass is lateral to entire SCM) Sub-platysmal flaps created and avoid EJ vein damage Omohypoid divided between heads of SCM and IJ mobilized laterally (bypass IJ is mobilized medially to expose CCA and care must be taken to avoid phrenic nerve in more lateral approach) CCA is reflected medially with vagus nerve  On the left side, the thoracic duct is identifiable and divided followed by dividing the vertebral vein Subclavian artery and proximal branches identified (anterior scalene is in lateral dissection) What are some common complications after carotid subclavian bypass in order of highest to lowest incidence? Complications31 Phrenic nerve palsy   Recurrent laryngeal palsy   Lymphatic leak   Neck hematoma   When carotid-subclavian bypass compared to transposition?   Vertebral artery takes origin from the subclavian artery in a very proximal position, then Bypass For coronary-subclavian steal with patent internal mammary artery to coronary artery bypass graft, then Bypass (a carotid-subclavian transposition requires a more proximal clamp with occlusion of inline antegrade flow to the coronary bypass during the procedure) References "],["thoracic-outlet-syndrome.html", "Chapter 4 Thoracic Outlet Syndrome 4.1 ", " Chapter 4 Thoracic Outlet Syndrome Your browser does not support the audio tag; for browser support, please see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 4.1 "],["abdominaliliacperipheral-aneurysms.html", "Chapter 5 Abdominal/Iliac/Peripheral Aneurysms 5.1 ", " Chapter 5 Abdominal/Iliac/Peripheral Aneurysms Your browser does not support the audio tag; for browser support, please see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 5.1 "],["lower-extremity-occlusive-disease.html", "Chapter 6 Lower Extremity Occlusive Disease 6.1 ", " Chapter 6 Lower Extremity Occlusive Disease Your browser does not support the audio tag; for browser support, please see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 6.1 "],["mesenteric-disease.html", "Chapter 7 Mesenteric Disease 7.1 ", " Chapter 7 Mesenteric Disease Your browser does not support the audio tag; for browser support, please see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 7.1 "],["renal.html", "Chapter 8 Renal 8.1 ", " Chapter 8 Renal Your browser does not support the audio tag; for browser support, please see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 8.1 "],["thoracic-outlet.html", "Chapter 9 Thoracic Outlet 9.1 ", " Chapter 9 Thoracic Outlet Your browser does not support the audio tag; for browser support, please see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 9.1 "],["venous-disease.html", "Chapter 10 Venous Disease 10.1 ", " Chapter 10 Venous Disease Your browser does not support the audio tag; for browser support, please see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 10.1 "],["vascular-trauma.html", "Chapter 11 Vascular Trauma 11.1 ", " Chapter 11 Vascular Trauma Your browser does not support the audio tag; for browser support, please see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 11.1 "],["angioaccess.html", "Chapter 12 Angioaccess 12.1 ", " Chapter 12 Angioaccess Your browser does not support the audio tag; for browser support, please see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 12.1 "],["complications.html", "Chapter 13 Complications 13.1 ", " Chapter 13 Complications Your browser does not support the audio tag; for browser support, please see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 13.1 "],["amputations.html", "Chapter 14 Amputations 14.1 ", " Chapter 14 Amputations Your browser does not support the audio tag; for browser support, please see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 14.1 "],["vascular-lab.html", "Chapter 15 Vascular Lab 15.1 ", " Chapter 15 Vascular Lab Your browser does not support the audio tag; for browser support, please see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 15.1 "],["vascular-medicine.html", "Chapter 16 Vascular Medicine 16.1 ", " Chapter 16 Vascular Medicine Your browser does not support the audio tag; for browser support, please see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 16.1 "],["endovascular.html", "Chapter 17 Endovascular 17.1 ", " Chapter 17 Endovascular Your browser does not support the audio tag; for browser support, please see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 17.1 "],["applied-science.html", "Chapter 18 Applied Science 18.1 ", " Chapter 18 Applied Science Your browser does not support the audio tag; for browser support, please see: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp 18.1 "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
