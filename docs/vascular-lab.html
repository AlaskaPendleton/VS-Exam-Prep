<p>So let’s start with an overview of ultrasound modalities, waveforms, and
changes proximal and distal to flow-limiting stenosis:</p>
<div id="overview" class="section level2" number="15.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.1</span> <strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Brief overview of ultrasound:</strong> Ultrasonography uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_wave">sound
waves</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency">frequencies</a> higher
than those audible to humans. Ultrasound images are created by sending
pulses of ultrasound
into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)">tissue</a> using
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound_transducer#Use_in_medicine">probe</a>.
Reflected pulses are recorded and displayed as an image. There are many
types of ultrasound images, but two modes commonly seen in vascular
ultrasonography are B-mode and doppler:</p>
<p><strong>B-mode (Brightness) imaging</strong> is a 2-D, black and white display of
tissue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_impedance">acoustic
impedance</a>s.</p>
<p><strong>Doppler mode</strong> uses the Doppler effect to measure and visualize blood
flow.</p>
<p><strong>Spectral Doppler</strong> converts frequency shifts from moving blood to
velocities using the Doppler equation, and displays a “spectrum” of
these frequencies as Doppler waveforms.</p>
<p><strong>Color Doppler</strong> presents velocity information as a color-coded overlay
on top of a B-mode image. Duplex ultrasonography is a term commonly used
for the simultaneous presentation of B-mode and doppler data.</p>
<div id="waveforms" class="section level3" number="15.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.1.1</span> Waveforms</h3>
<p><strong>What do normal spectral waveforms look like?</strong></p>
<p><u>Normal spectral waveform:</u></p>
<p>Brisk upstroke, sharp peak, rapid downstroke. A spectral window under
the waveform, that is that black space between the spectral waveform and
the 0 velocity axis, represents the absence of lower velocities. This
is indicative of laminar flow within the vessel (Image 1: normal
spectrum waveform)</p>
<p>How can we differentiate high vs low resistance waveforms?</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide2.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p><u>Low vs high resistance waveforms:</u></p>
<p>Waveform profiles change depending upon the nature of the distal
vascular bed being supplied. Organs like the brain, kidneys, liver, and
spleen have constant high metabolic demand, and are therefore low
resistance vascular beds. Waveforms for arteries supplying these organs
demonstrate constant forward flow throughout the cardiac cycle because
the distal bed being supplied has low resistance leading to high
end-diastolic flow.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide3.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p>This would also be seen in the postprandial SMA. In contrast, high
resistance waveforms are seen for arteries supplying resting peripheral
muscles, fasted mesenteric beds (such as the fasting SMA), and the
External carotid artery. High resistance waveforms are characterized by
triphasic morphology (preprandial  SMA or ECA).</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide4.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p>That is, sharp peaks, early diastolic flow reversal, brief forward flow
from elastic recoil of the artery, and then no flow during the remainder
of the diastolic phase.</p>
<p><strong>How does flow-limiting stenosis change the waveform?</strong></p>
<p>First let’s define <u>Stenosis:</u> A hemodynamically significant
stenosis (area reduction &gt;50%) will result in a doubling of velocity
from the inflow segment to the area of maximal stenosis (velocity ratio
&gt; 2).</p>
<p><strong>Now what do waveforms look like AFTER a flow-limiting stenosis?</strong></p>
<p><u>Tardus et parvus</u> refers to a pattern of Doppler ultrasound
spectral waveform resulting from arterial stenosis. The tardus et parvus
waveform is delayed with prolonged systolic acceleration (tardus) and
diminished with a small systolic amplitude and rounded systolic peak
(parvus). This phenomenon is observed downstream from the site of
stenosis. Tardus parvus in the CFA? Upstream (iliac) stenosis. Tardus
parvus in the brachial artery? Upstream (subclavian or axillary)
stenosis.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide5.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p><strong>So what will the waveform look like BEFORE a flow-limiting stenosis?</strong></p>
<p><u>Distal stenosis:</u> Distal occlusive disease will result in a high
resistance waveform, with absent diastolic flow. (Image 5: Distal
stenosis with absent diastolic flow)</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide6.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p>Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s move through by organ- system
high-yield vascular lab studies, findings, and pathologies.We’ll start
with the extracranial evaluation, a highly-tested area of vascular
ultrasonography.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="extracranial" class="section level2" number="15.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.2</span> Extracranial</h2>
<p><strong>What does a typical extracranial evaluation involve?</strong></p>
<p>Examine CCA (2 views), ICA (2 views), ECA, vertebral arteries</p>
<p><strong>What are normal ICA and ECA waveforms?</strong></p>
<p><u>Normal ECA vs ICA waveform:</u> The external carotid artery waveform
reflects a high resistance vascular bed. This means minimal diastolic
flow. Conversely, the ICA waveform reflects a low resistance vascular
bed with antegrade diastolic flow.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide7.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p>This makes sense, as the ICA is supplying the brain while the ECA is
supplying the face. Intuitively, the common carotid artery  is a mixture
of the ICA and ECA waveform morphologies. Like the ICA with forward flow
throughout diastole, but less as compared to the ICA due to the high
resistance influence of the ECA.</p>
<p>Another way of differentiating the external and internal carotid
arteries is the “temporal tap”. Tapping on the superficial temporal
artery (a branch of the ECA) will be transmitted as small pulsations in
the diastolic component of the external carotid artery.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide8.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about diagnostic criteria for ICA stenosis?</strong></p>
<p><u>Parameters for ICA stenosis</u>: These are a few numbers that are
(unfortunately) essential to memorize for the VSITE and RPVI.</p>
<p>Although criteria differ between guidelines, the Carotid Consensus
Criteria, define ICA stenosis &gt;= 70% as a peak systolic velocity &gt;=
230 cm/sec, EDV &gt; 100 cm/sec, and ICA/CCA ratio &gt; 4.0. Of note,
post-stenting criteria vary from pre-stenting criteria. Stenosis
criteria are not clearly defined for the CCA or ECA.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide9.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p><strong>When is surgery indicated for ICA stenosis?</strong></p>
<p><u>Parameters for when surgery indicated:</u></p>
<p>Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) &gt;60% stenosis
asymptomatic, NASCET &gt;50% stenosis symptomatic</p>
<p><strong>Let’s talk about other pathologies that can be visualized on
extracranial ultrasound:</strong></p>
<p><u>Pathologies:</u> Stenosis (plaque), dissection (flap), aneurysms
(rare), occlusion (no flow, do not operate), carotid body tumor
(splaying of ECA/ICA, fed by ECA branches), FMD.</p>
<p>FMD is frequently encountered on the VSITE/RPVI. How would this appear
on the exams?</p>
<p><u>Fibromuscular dysplasia</u> of the internal carotid arteries affects
women more commonly than men. Duplex findings show a “chain of lakes”
appearance, demonstrative of multiple septa and small aneurysms.
Velocity elevations and increased turbulence in the waveform patterns is
typically found on Doppler interrogation.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide10.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p><strong>How to treat?</strong></p>
<p>Aspirin if asymptomatic, POBA if symptomatic.</p>
<p><strong>Are there other frequently tested pathologies demonstrated on
extracranial exam?</strong></p>
<p><u>Subclavian steal:</u> Subclavian steal occurs when a proximal
subclavian stenosis or occlusion leads to reversal of vertebral artery
flow. This causes “stealing” of  blood from the posterior cerebral
circulation, and presents as vertebrobasilar insufficiency. How does
this look on duplex? Normal vertebral flow looks very similar to ICA:
antegrade low resistance waveforms with constant forward flow throughout
the cardiac cycle. As subclavian stenosis progresses, one can see
mid-systolic velocity decelerations (’bunny ears”) , and with severe
steal, there is a complete reversal of flow in the vertebral artery
towards the arm rather than towards the brain.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide11.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p><u>Innominate stenosis:</u> A phenomenon that is related to this, is
innominate stenosis. Here again the patient will present with
vertebrobasilar insufficiency, indicative of diminished vertebral
antegrade flow, but additionally will experience right hemispheric
insufficiency secondary to diminished R ICA antegrade flow. The
right-side duplex will demonstrate flow reversal in the vertebral
artery, abnormal waveforms in the subclavian, as well as steal pattern
waveforms in the common and internal carotid arteries. The common
denominator for all of these findings is significant disease in the
innominate artery.</p>
</div>
<div id="intracranial" class="section level2" number="15.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.3</span> Intracranial</h2>
<p>So that covers extracranial vascular lab evaluation. What about
intracranial? This is less frequently tested, so we will discuss just a
brief overview of views and some of the more commonly tested
pathologies.</p>
<p><u><strong>Intracranial:</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Three primary views: temporal, foraminal (occipital), orbital views</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Temporal view:</strong> Used to interrogate PCA, ACA, MCA, and ICA.
The MCA, ICA and PCA flow direction is towards the probe, the ,
The ACA flow direction is AWAY.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Occipital view:</strong> Basilar and vertebral arteries (both away).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Orbital view:</strong> Ophthalmic and ICA</p></li>
<li><p>Arteries differentiated by depth. MCA 3-6 cm, everything else
deeper.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are some frequently tested pathologies that are identified on
TCD?</strong></p>
<p>Indications often tested:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>MCA spasm (severe PSV&gt;200)</u>: Can be seen in sickle cell
disease with studies indicating a strong correlation between mean
velocities of &gt;200cm/s and the rate of stroke in children with
sickle cell disease. With blood transfusions, stroke risk can be
reduced from &gt;10% to &lt;1% per year.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-bulasTranscranialDopplerTCD2000" role="doc-biblioref">185</a>]</sup></span></p></li>
<li><p><u>Cerebral ischemia during CEA:</u> Comparing transcranial Doppler
sonography, near-infrared spectroscopy, stump pressure measurement,
and somatosensory evoked potentials, cerebral ischemia was most
accurately predicted by the percent change in transcranial Doppler
detected middle cerebral artery velocity. Detection of a greater
than 50% drop in middle cerebral artery velocity using transcranial
Doppler is 100% sensitive for detecting cerebral
ischemia.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-moritzAccuracyCerebralMonitoring2007" role="doc-biblioref">186</a>]</sup></span></p></li>
<li><p>TCD can also demonstrate microemboli (high spikes on spectral
doppler) during CEA</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="upper-extremity" class="section level2" number="15.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.4</span> Upper Extremity</h2>
<p>Having covered head and neck vasculature, let’s move on to peripheral
vasculature. This is a huge area both on the VSITE/RPVI and in practice.
In this section we’ll cover first the upper, then the lower extremity
vasculature.</p>
<p><strong>So first, what are characteristics of waveforms in the peripheral
vasculature?</strong></p>
<p><u>Peripheral</u>: Normal waveforms are indicative of high resistance
distal beds, so we would expect triphasic waveforms</p>
<p><strong>What are normal arterial parameters in the upper extremities?</strong></p>
<p><u>Upper Extremity:</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Normal parameters:</strong> Normal pressure gradient between the right
and left brachial pressures is &lt;20 mmHg. Normal finger pressure
is &gt;80% of the ipsilateral brachial systolic pressure. So a normal
digital brachial index is &gt;=0.80. A gradient between digits of &gt;15
mmHg is considered abnormal. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Let’s talk about some of the most frequently tested pathologies,
starting with arterial TOS.</strong></p>
<p><u>Arterial TOS:</u> Results from compression of the subclavian artery
at the level of the first rib within the scalene triangle. Arterial TOS
testing is done by placing a sensor, most often photoplethysmography
(PPG), on one finger of each hand, recording the resting waveforms and
then recording while during maneuvers to evoke arterial compression in
the thoracic outlet.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us a little more about PPG testing?</strong></p>
<p><u>Photoplethysmography (PPG)</u> uses an infrared light to illuminate
superficial tissue. The reflection is received by a photosensor, and
amplitude of the reflected light is proportional to the volume of red
blood cells in the sample area. A normal digital arterial PPG has a
brisk upstroke with a narrow systolic peak, and a dicrotic notch on the
downslope during diastole.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide12.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p>Digital PPGs change with progression of peripheral vascular disease. The
first changes are a loss of amplitude and loss of the dicrotic notch.
More advanced disease findings include a flattened systolic peak and a
prolonged upstroke. Significant arterial TOS is suggested when there is
a loss or persistent flattening of the digit waveforms during any of the
positional changes that can compress the subclavian artery (either with
the clavicle, first rib and scalene muscle). However, it should be noted
that up to one-third of patients without arterial TOS may have some
degree of subclavian artery compression with positional maneuvers.</p>
<p><strong>What are other diseases affecting the upper extremity?</strong></p>
<p><u>Raynaud’s:</u> Vasospastic disorder characterized by temporary
vasospasm. Diagnosis may be assisted by decrease in digital waveforms
with immersion of the hand in cold water.</p>
<p><u>Thromboangiitis obliterans:</u> Is a segmental non-atherosclerotic
inflammatory disorder characterized by microthrombosis that primarily
involves the small- and medium-sized arteries. Ultrasonography may
demonstrate the classical “corkscrew” collateral development at the
level of occlusion. TA has a male predominance and first line treatment
is smoking cessation.</p>
<div id="hemodialysis-access" class="section level3" number="15.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.4.1</span> Hemodialysis Access</h3>
<p>Before we segue to the lower extremities, this is a good time to discuss
an entity frequently tested on the VSITE, and that constitutes for many
vascular surgeons a notable portion of their practice, and that is
hemodialysis access, and specifically fistulas.</p>
<p><u>Fistulas</u>: Ultrasound is one of the key modalities used in
identifying suitable anatomy for fistula placement, suitability of a
fistula for dialysis, and finally complications of fistulas.</p>
<p><strong>So first, assessment for fistula placement:</strong></p>
<p>The optimal configuration for an AVF is determined on the basis of vein
mapping and noninvasive studies. Veins should measure &gt;3 mm in diameter
(&gt;2.5 mm may be acceptable, as veins are likely to dilate under
anesthesia), and there should be no arterial inflow stenosis or venous
outflow stenosis. Duplex ultrasound arterial imaging can be performed at
the same time as vein mapping and can provide important predictors of
fistula maturation, such as arterial diameter and flow. The minimal
arterial lumen diameter is 2 mm.</p>
<p><strong>How can we tell if a fistula is ready to be used for hemodialysis
access?</strong></p>
<p><u>Assessment for fistula suitability for dialysis:</u> Rule of 6’s: At
six weeks post-creation the diameter of the fistula should be at least 6
mm and the depth no more than 0.6 cm. The flow rate should be at least
600mL/min, and the length of the fistula should be 6 cm to allow for a
successful two-needle dialysis.</p>
<p><strong>What do normal fistula spectral waveforms look like?</strong></p>
<p><u>Waveform:</u> The arterial waveform should demonstrate very low
resistance throughout diastole. End diastolic velocity should be one
half to two thirds of peak systolic velocity in a well-functioning
fistula. As a side note, this is also what one would see in an
iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula, as between the femoral artery and
vein.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s discuss commonly encountered complications and pathologies
identified in association with fistulas:</strong></p>
<p><u>Pseudoaneurysms:</u> Pseudoaneurysms commonly occur when a puncture
fails to seal and the blood is contained by the surrounding soft tissue.
As in other locations, pseudoaneurysms are defined on imaging by a
communicating neck between the arterial vessel and pseudoaneurysmal sac
with “to-and-fro” waveform at duplex. While small pseudoaneurysms can be
managed without intervention or surgery, larger pseudoaneurysms,
pseudoaneurysms associated with infection or overlying skin changes or
bleeding may require excision and repair.</p>
<p><u>Steal syndrome:</u> Hemodialysis-related steal, also known as
access-related hand ischemia, which may occur in over half of all
patients undergoing access creation. Steal is characterized by
retrograde diastolic flow distal to the donor artery. Of note, reversal
of flow in and of itself is not sufficient to cause distal ischemia with
an intact palmar arch. This is commonly seen after access creation and
represents physiologic steal phenomenon, rather than symptomatic steal
syndrome. Digital pressures &lt;60 mm Hg are highly sensitive and specific
for predicting steal. Patients who have no symptoms (Grade 1
access-related hand ischemia), may be closely monitored without any
intervention. How do we treat more severe steal? Flow rate measurements
of the fistula can help determine the optimal treatment (banding,
revision using distal inflow, distal revascularization with interval
ligation, proximalization of arterial inflow or ligation of the
fistula).</p>
<p><strong>So steal can occur in the context of high fistula output, can we talk
a bit about low fistula flow, as from stenosis?</strong></p>
<p><u>Central venous stenosis:</u> Venous outflow stenosis is the most
common reason for arteriovenous graft failure. A low flow rate results
in recirculation during the dialysis session. Venous obstruction
manifests as arm swelling, and with central venous stenosis may present
with collateral development over the upper extremity and chest wall.</p>
<p><u>Stenosis of fistula:</u> Arterial and mid-graft stenosis can also
cause complications, but are less common than venous stenosis. Stenosis
on imaging will be represented by narrowing of luminal diameter on
b-mode ultrasound, high-resistance waveform proximal to the stenosis,
and tardus parvus waveform distal to the stenosis.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="lower-extremity" class="section level2" number="15.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.5</span> Lower Extremity</h2>
<p><strong>Can you please tell us about some of the diagnostic modalities that
are used to examine perfusion in the lower extremities?</strong></p>
<p><u>ABIs:</u> Ankle-brachial index measurement requires calculating the
ratio of the highest ankle systolic pressure (posterior tibial artery or
dorsalis pedis) over the highest brachial systolic pressure. Regardless
of whether you’re doing the R or L ABI, use the higher arm pressure for
both ratios. Normal ABI &gt;0.9, severe disease indicated by ABI&lt;0.5, and
CLI by ABI&lt;0.3. The ankle-brachial index in diabetic patients is
frequently unreliable due to incompressibility of the tibial vessels at
the level of the cuff secondary to calcification. Consequently, toe
pressures are mandatory in all patients with diabetes mellitus. Normal
TBI&gt;0.7.</p>
<p><u>TcPO2:</u> When there is significant tissue loss, preventing TBI
measurement, another option is transcutaneous oximetry
(TcPO2).  Transcutaneous oximetry is a non-invasive method of measuring
the tissue partial pressure of oxygen through a heated sensor on the
skin. A TcPO2 value of 40 mmHg is the critical value below which wound
healing is impaired and ischemia develops.</p>
<p><strong>Are there other non-invasive ways of determining extremity
perfusion?</strong></p>
<p><u>PVRs:</u> Pulse volume recordings. Normal PVR waveforms have a rapid
upstroke, sharp peak, prominent dicrotic notch and downslope. Typically
4 cuffs. High thigh cuff should be 30% greater than brachial pressure,
hence a thigh-brachial index of 1.3 is normal. However, ABI/PVRs may not
demonstrate significantly abnormal values/waveforms in individuals with
single level disease.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide13.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p><u>Exercise Test:</u> During exercise testing, patients are placed on a
treadmill after baseline resting ABIs are measured. The patient is then
asked to walk for 5 minutes or until physical discomfort requires test
cessation. The point when a patient stops is defined as the absolute
claudication distance. Diagnostic criteria for a positive test include a
drop-in ankle pressure of greater than 20 mmHg from baseline, drop in
ABI greater than 0.2 from baseline, or inability of ankle pressures to
return to baseline after 3 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>So just to briefly summarize, what are parameters associated with poor
wound healing?</strong></p>
<p><u>Parameters associated with poor wound healing:</u> Considering these
various testing modalities, what are factors associated with poor
likelihood of wound healing? An ankle pressure &lt;50 mmHg, ABI &lt; 0.40,
TcPO2 &lt;20 mmHg, or a toe pressure &lt;20 mmHg are considered predictive
of non-healing.</p>
<p><strong>Ultrasound is frequently used for graft surveillance. Can you talk
about graft surveillance parameters?</strong></p>
<p><u>Restenosis/Graft surveillance</u>: Suggested ultrasound surveillance
bypass graft begins immediately after surgery and then continues at 3,
6, and 12 months and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter. A velocity
ratio (Vr) is defined as the peak systolic velocity (PSV) at the site of
a stenosis divided by the PSV in a normal vessel segment proximal to the
stenosis. The highest risk for graft thrombosis, and highest cause for
concern is suggested by PSV &gt;300 cm/s, Vr &gt;3.5, a graft flow velocity
&lt;45 cm/s or a drop in ABI &gt;0.15.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-bandykHemodynamicsVeinGraft1988" role="doc-biblioref">187</a>]</sup></span></p>
<div id="pathologies" class="section level3" number="15.5.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.5.1</span> Pathologies</h3>
<p><strong>Let’s talk about pathologies frequently encountered in the lower
extremities:</strong></p>
<p><u>Pseudoaneurysms (particularly femoral):</u> Gray-scale
ultrasonography demonstrates a hypoechoic cystic structure adjacent to
an arterial supply. Color Doppler typically demonstrates a “yin-yang
sign” within the pseudoaneurysm sac. The hallmark ultrasound sign is
identification of a neck between the sac and the feeding artery with a
“to-and-fro” spectral Doppler waveform measured at the neck. This
represents the flow in and out of the PSA during systole and diastole.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide14.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p><u>Dissections:</u> Characteristic ultrasound findings on color Doppler
include a parallel blood-flow channel that separates the true and false
lumen.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide15.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p>Of note, if the false lumen is filled by a thrombus, it may not
distinguishable from an intramural hematoma or noncalcified plaque</p>
<p>There are several disease pathologies that are frequently tested
relating to the popliteal fossa. Can you talk briefly about these?</p>
<p><u>Adventitial cystic disease:</u> This is a rare (but often tested)
pathology. Adventitial cystic disease is a nonatherosclerotic etiology
of claudication, most often affecting the popliteal artery in the lower
extremity and leading to stenosis or occlusion. Duplex imaging of the
popliteal artery will demonstrate an anechoic <em>intraluminal</em> region with
a smooth contour and stenosis documented by velocity increase on
spectral doppler.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide16.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p>This is not to be confused with a</p>
<p><u>Bakers Cyst</u><strong>:</strong> which is a benign, cystic structure found in the
popliteal fossa and arising from the joint capsule. Flexion of the knee
may result in compression of the popliteal artery by the cyst. On b-mode
ultrasound, a well-defined, anechoic  cystic structure with a ‘neck’
extending into the joint space between the semimembranosus tendon and
the medial head of the gastrocnemius will be identified.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide17.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p><u>Popliteal entrapment syndrome:</u> decrease in ABI or loss of distal
pulses with passive dorsiflexion or active plantar flexion of the foot
caused by compression of the popliteal artery by the gastrocnemius.</p>

<div id="aorta" class="section level3" number="15.6.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.6.1</span> Aorta</h3>
<p><strong>AAA:</strong> Ultrasound screening of a AAA is non-invasive, accurate, and
cost-effective. Sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 99% for AAA

women, measured outer wall to outer wall cross-sectional diameter.</p>
<p><strong>Can ultrasound be used for graft surveillance s/p EVAR?</strong></p>
<p><u>S/p EVAR:</u> Surveillance color duplex ultrasound is safe if CT
imaging at 1 year exhibits no sac growth, graft migration, or endoleak
(or stable type II endoleak). Can detect endoleaks, sac expansion, and
limb occlusion. Migration difficult to assess given challenge of renal
arteries visualization in a long axis view of the aorta.</p>

atherosclerotic lesion that penetrates the intima and progresses into
the media. Associated with atherosclerotic plaque on ultrasound</p>
<p><u>Dissections:</u> (as already discussed) a dissection flap is usually
identified and color flow demonstrates dual channels (true and false
lumens). Turbulent flow patterns are frequently encountered.</p>

<div id="mesenteric-vasculature" class="section level3" number="15.6.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.6.2</span> Mesenteric Vasculature</h3>
<p>So far we have steered clear of the mesenteric vasculature. But this is
an area frequently encountered on exams. Let’s start with mesenteric
vessel stenosis.</p>
<p><strong>Celiac and SMA stenosis:</strong> May present as chronic mesenteric
ischemia. PSV &gt;275 cm/s in the SMA or &gt;200 cm/s in the celiac artery
indicates &gt;=70% stenosis. Normal SMA Doppler waveforms in the fasting
patient show high resistance waveform, PSV &lt;275 cm/s and no spectral
broadening. In the postprandial state, the waveform becomes low
resistance, with a slightly increased PSV and little to no spectral
broadening. Significant SMA stenosis may be differentiated by the
presence of spectral broadening and elevated PSV and EDV. Distal to the
stenosis, one would expect a tardus parvis waveform. EDV &gt;45 in SMA or
&gt;55 in celiac are predictive of stenosis (would expect higher diastolic
flow in celiac trunk given low resistance vascular bed of liver and
spleen).</p>
<p><strong>What other mesenteric vessel pathologies may be identified on vascular
ultrasound?</strong></p>
<p><u>Dissections:</u> Rare without concomitant aortic dissection.</p>
<p><u>Aneurysms:</u> Rare. Repair &gt;2 cm celiac, hepatic, SMA aneurysms and
&gt;3 cm splenic and renal.</p>
<p><u>Median arcuate ligament syndrome:</u> MALS can cause significantly
elevated velocities at the origin of the celiac artery. Testing is for
reversible mechanical compression, as opposed to a fixed lesion from
atherosclerotic disease. During deep inspiration or in the upright
position, celiac velocities should normalize if stenosis is secondary to
MALS.</p>
<p><strong>So I recognize that we are jumping ahead here discussing venous
circulation, but as this represents another component of a mesenteric
vascular exam, let’s discuss portal venous ultrasonography.</strong></p>
<p><u>Portal vein:</u> Normal portal venous flow is hepatopetal (toward the
liver), whereas abnormal portal venous flow is hepatofugal (away from
the liver). (The root “fugua” means to flee, or flight). Flow should be
in the same direction as the hepatic artery. Other abnormalities that
may be visualized are portal vein thrombosis (often associated with
portal venous hypertension in patients with chronic cirrhosis,
hepatitis, or hepatocellular carcinoma). Acute portal vein thrombosis on
ultrasound demonstrates dilatation of the portal vein with hypoechoic
intraluminal thrombus. Chronic portal vein thrombosis is characterized
by a contracted vein with heterogeneous/hyperechoic echoes and may be
associated with collateral formation.  Can also assess for hepatic
artery stenosis/thrombosis and for functioning of TIPS (transjugular
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt).</p>
<p><strong>Awesome, and so before jumping fully into venous circulation, let’s
complete our discussion of abdominal ultrasound evaluation with a
discussion of the renal vasculature.</strong></p>
<p><u>Renal Pathologies:</u> ostial (atherosclerotic) vs mid-artery (FMD)</p>
<p><u>Atherosclerotic stenosis:</u> PSV&gt;200 cm/s predictive of &gt;60%
stenosis. Renal artery-to-aortic PSV ratio (RAR) &gt;3.5 also correlates
with a &gt;60% stenosis. The renal resistive index (RRI) is calculated as
the RA PSV-EDV/PSV. The RRI (&gt;0.8) is an indicator of intrinsic
parenchymal renal disease.</p>
<p><u>FMD:</u> As discussed for the carotids, FMD manifests as beaded
lesions in medium and small arteries, with the renal arteries the most
commonly affected. Ultrasound demonstrates increased PSV in the mid and
distal renal artery. Stenoses in the mid and distal renal artery are
suggestive of FMD, atherosclerotic disease is primarily ostial in
nature.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="venous" class="section level2" number="15.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.7</span> Venous</h2>
<p><strong>Venous Exam:</strong> Uses a linear transducer. Complete deep venous reflux
duplex examination includes color and pulsed wave spectral doppler
imaging. Spontaneous Doppler waveforms as well as provocative maneuvers
are recorded in the common femoral, femoral, popliteal, and tibial deep
veins. Superficial veins (GSV, SSV, and perforator veins) are evaluated
with provocative maneuvers to test valve competency. Diameters are also
included for superficial veins. Transverse B-mode images are used for
vessel compression (as when looking for thrombus) to ensure that the
vein is fully compressible under probe pressure as opposed to simply
slipping out of view, as may occur in longitudinal views. Reflux exam
should be performed with a patient standing, with assessment performed
on the non weight-bearing leg.</p>
<p><strong>We’ve talked extensively about normal arterial waveforms; what do
normal venous waveforms look like?</strong></p>
<p><u>Normal venous waveforms:</u> Normal flow patterns of iliac and
femoral veins demonstrate phasicity and should augment with distal
compression. In the upper extremity central veins, doppler waveforms
normally demonstrate pulsatility and phasicity.</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean? Pulsatility, phasicity, and augmentation</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Pulsatility:</strong> Refers to changes in the venous waveform in accordance
with the cardiac cycle. Pulsatility is normal in the upper extremity
veins central veins, given their proximity to the heart.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide18.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p>This is an abnormal finding in the lower extremity veins, and may be a
sign of pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, or tricuspid
regurgitation.</p>
<p><strong>Phasicity:</strong> (also called respiratory phasicity) is variation in the
waveform with respiration. This results from increasing and decreasing
intrathoracic pressures secondary to respiration. Phasicity is an
indicator of a patency proximal to the point of measurement. So if we
see lack of phasicity (continuous flow) in the left femoral vein but
normal phasicity in the right, we would be concerned for left iliac vein
occlusion or stenosis. If we saw absence of phasicity (continuous flow)
in the bilateral femoral veins, we would be concerned for IVC
obstruction or stenosis.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide19.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p><strong>Augmentation:</strong> Distal compression that augments forward flow. For
example, if we are measuring flow at the femoral vein and we squeeze the
calf and we see augmentation in the waveform, this indicates lack of
occlusion in the venous system from the knee to the probe.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide20.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p><strong>What are venous pathologies that are commonly tested/encountered?</strong></p>
<p><u>Reflux:</u> Venous reflux due to valvular incompetence is best
assessed with duplex scanning in the upright position. Reflux in the
common femoral vein and the saphenofemoral junction may be elicited with
a Valsalva maneuver (which increases intra-abdominal pressure), but
release of a pneumatic cuff compression is a more reproducible method.
Reflux is identified as reverse flow - that is, away from the heart -
following valsalva or release of the compression cuff.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide21.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p>Consensus guidelines suggest a cutoff value of 1 second for abnormally
reversed flow (reflux) in the femoral and popliteal veins and of 0.5
seconds for the great saphenous vein, small saphenous vein, tibial, and
deep femoral veins.</p>
<p><u>Perforator veins:</u> Perforator veins connect the deep and
superficial venous systems, penetrating the deep fascia overlying the
muscle.  Size &gt;3.5 mm and reflux &gt;350 ms (deep to superficial) is
associated with perforator reflux. Pathological perforator = in
association with a healed or non-healed ulcer.</p>
<p><strong>What are some other examples of reflux?</strong></p>
<p><u>Ovarian vein reflux:</u> The ultrasound evaluation of pelvic
congestion syndrome is performed in steep reverse Trendelenburg and
standing positions with a low-frequency probe. Reflux is identified
during the Valsalva maneuver. There are no validated criteria for the
duration of reflux. Rather, an ovarian vein diameter &gt;6 mm is
considered significant.</p>
<p><u>May Thurner</u><strong>:</strong> Also known as iliac vein compression syndrome,
refers to a chronic compression of the left <a href="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/common-iliac-vein?lang=us">common iliac
vein</a> by the
overlying right <a href="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/common-iliac-artery?lang=us">common iliac
artery</a> (CIA),
with or without <a href="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/deep-vein-thrombosis?lang=us">deep venous
thrombosis</a>.
Notably, patients present with unilateral (left) lower extremity edema
and pain, varicosities, DVT or venous ulcers. Intravascular ultrasound
will demonstrate &gt;50% stenosis of the iliac vein from compression.
Distal waveforms will demonstrate absence of phasicity if
obstruction/stenosis is severe with continuous flow.</p>
<p><strong>Ok, let’s transition from reflux to thrombosis:</strong></p>
<p><u>Thrombosis:</u> Characteristics of acute thrombus are an echolucent
and incompressible thrombus in a thin-walled vein with significant
distension.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide22.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p>Acute thrombus typically causes the vein to dilate with a diameter
greater than the diameter of the adjacent artery. Venous wall
thickening/scarring, a contracted vein, recanalization, and
collateralization is found in chronic thrombosis.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s discuss 2 Specific examples of venous thrombosis: VTOS and
EHIT</strong></p>
<p><u>Venous TOS:</u> Venous thoracic outlet syndrome is thrombosis or
severe stenosis of the subclavian or axillary veins secondary to chronic
extrinsic mechanical compression. Repetitive injury to the subclavian
vein at the level of the costoclavicular space results in chronic injury
to the veins. Venous duplex may show a dilated, non-compressible vein
consistent with an acute subclavian vein DVT, or lack of
pulsatility/phasicity if obstruction/stenosis is more centrally located.</p>
<p><u>EHIT or Endovenous Heat Induced Thrombosis:</u> S/p endovenous
thermal ablations (RFA or laser ablation) of the GSV. 4 Grades: Grade 1
is thrombus in the GSV up to the level of the CFV. If &lt; 50% of the CFV
lumen is involved this is EHIT grade 2. EHIT grade 3 is extension into
the CFV occupying &gt;50% of the lumen and grade 4 is occlusion of the
CFV.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide23.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p>EHIT grades 3-4 are typically treated with anticoagulation to reduce
risk of PE. To minimize the risk of EHIT, the catheter should be
positioned at least 2 cm from the saphenofemoral junction.</p>
</div>
<div id="artifacts" class="section level2" number="15.8">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.8</span> Artifacts</h2>
<p>Finally, let’s wrap up this episode with a discussion of imaging
artifacts. These are frequently encountered and tested in vascular
ultrasound, and it is important to recognize imaging artifacts in order
to prevent incorrect interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Acoustic shadowing:</strong> Shadowing on an ultrasound image is
characterized by a signal void behind structures that strongly absorb,
reflect, or refract ultrasonic waves.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide24.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p>Practically speaking, this most typically occurs deep to strongly
reflective surfaces such as calcified plaques, and appears as a “dark
area” beneath the plaque. <strong>Acoustic enhancement</strong> is essentially the
inverse situation, and appears as a “bright area” deep to structures
that transmit ultrasound waves exceptionally well. This can happen deep
to fluid-filled structures such as cysts.</p>
<p><strong>Mirroring</strong>: A mirror-image artifact is caused by reverberation of
ultrasound and shows structures that exist on one side of a strong
reflector as also being present on the other side of the reflector.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide25.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p>This is often seen around the pleura and the diaphragm, due to the
strong reflection of ultrasound from the air-filled lung. These
artifacts can occur in both B-mode imaging where you see the mirrored
image and Doppler, in which you see the mirrored waveform.</p>
<p><strong>Refraction:</strong> A refraction artifact is the result of ultrasound waves
passing through tissues with different propagation velocities (such as
air and water) and causes a structure to be improperly positioned
laterally in the image. This is the phenomenon that results in a straw
appearing bent when in a glass of water.</p>
<p><strong>Speed artifact:</strong> Depth determination by an ultrasound machine is
based on calculations using an average propagation velocity of sound in
soft tissue of 1540 m/s. If the ultrasound wave passes through a medium
at a different speed than predicted by the machine, an inaccurate image
depth will be displayed. If the ultrasound passes less quickly through
the material than soft tissue (as occurs in air or fluid), then the
image will be displayed deeper than the true depth. In practical
application, this is what causes a “bayonet” sign, or apparent bending
of a needle when it passes from soft tissue into a cystic structure.</p>
<p><strong>Inappropriate color gain:</strong> Overly gained images will show “speckling”
in areas in which no flow is present (such as in soft tissue).</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide26.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p>Under-gaining will result in reduced sensitivity to low velocity flow.</p>
<p><strong>Inappropriate angle correction:</strong> Make sure the angle correction
cursor is centered in the vessel and parallel to the walls, otherwise
the Doppler velocity measurement will be incorrect.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide27.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p>Finally, can we talk about aliasing, as I feel like this comes up a lot
on exams:</p>
<p><strong>Aliasing:</strong> Unlike <a href="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/continuous-wave-doppler?lang=us">continuous wave
Doppler</a>,
pulsed wave and color flow Doppler are characterized by rapid pulses of
ultrasound waves (at a rate called the pulse repetition frequency).
The <a href="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/nyquist-limit?lang=us">Nyquist
limit</a> defines
the frequency at which aliasing will occur, as equal to the PRF/2. So
what does this mean practically? In pulsed wave doppler, if the velocity
of blood is greater than ½ the PRF, the peak velocity will be cut off,
and wrapped around to the bottom of the scale.</p>
<p><img src="images/vasc_lab/Slide28.jpeg" width="180" /></p>
<p>This results in inaccurate measurement of peak velocities, and may be
remedied by increasing the PRF and hence the scale. In color flow
doppler, aliasing appears as red to blue hues without separation of a
black region indicating no flow. This occurs in areas of high velocity
(such as immediately post-stenosis). This can be remedied with an
increase in the color scale. Of note, if asked to determine the
direction of blood flow in a vessel demonstrating aliasing, one should
assess the flow in low-velocity areas of blood flow, as seen along
vessel walls.</p>
