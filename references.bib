  abstract = {Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers in estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their decision making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a Web-based survey and revised during a 3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document. To aid the editorial process and readers of prediction model studies, it is recommended that authors include a completed checklist in their submission (also available at www.tripod-statement.org).

  abstract = {Background: The appropriateness of percutaneous intervention for moderate to severe carotid in-stent restenosis (C-ISR) is unclear. We therefore sought to compare stroke/death/myocardial infarction (MI) rates between percutaneous interventions and nonoperative management for \$50\% C-ISR. Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective review of consecutive patients presenting with \$50\% C-ISR to the vascular surgery service. Demographics, comorbidities, and intraoperative and postoperative variables were obtained. The degree of stenosis was verified by review of digital subtraction or computed tomography angiograms. The primary outcome was stroke/death/MI after the diagnosis of \$50\% C-ISR. c2, Kruskal-Wallis, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to quantify outcomes of the patients treated percutaneously vs nonoperatively. Results: During a 13-year period, 59 patients (75 C-ISRs) presented with \$50\% C-ISRs (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 58 male [98\%]; n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 57 C-ISRs asymptomatic [76\%]) with a median age of 67.5 years (62.8-74.6). The initial pathologic process underlying the original stent was atherosclerosis in 33 (70\%), radiation induced in 10 (21\%), prior carotid endarterectomy in 4 (9\%), and unknown in 28 (37\%). Forty C-ISRs underwent a percutaneous intervention (19 percutaneous angioplasty only [48\%]; 21 repeated stent and percutaneous angioplasty [52\%]). Median follow-up for the entire cohort was 948 days (283-2322) and similar between the intervention and nonintervention arms. There were no significant differences between the arms with respect to age (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .16), medical comorbidities (P {$>$} .05), original stent type (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .46), or clopidogrel use (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .74). At 30 days, there was one stroke and subsequent death in the intervention arm and none in the nonintervention arm. During the follow-up period, a median of 1.0 procedure was required to maintain patency. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, there were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and nonintervention arms with respect to stroke/death/MI as a composite or any of the individual components at last follow-up (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .82). Kaplan-Meier estimated patency was not significantly superior in the intervention vs the nonintervention arm (8.0 years 6 1.1 vs 5.3 years 6 0.7; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .14). Conclusions: Over 13 years, percutaneous interventions for \$50\% C-ISR were safe and durable. However, interventions fail to improve long-term stroke/death/MI or patency rates relative to nonintervention. Intervention for C-ISR may not be necessary, although future appropriately powered, prospective trials will be necessary to confirm these findings and to determine the appropriateness of interventions for C-ISR.

  abstract = {Background               A successful open surgical operation to remove atheromatous carotid artery narrowing that has not yet caused a stroke (asymptomatic carotid stenosis) carries some procedural risk but, if completed successfully, halves patients' future annual stroke risk for at least 10 years. A newer, less invasive alternative is carotid stenting, which also carries some procedural risk, especially if the carotid lesion has recently given rise to a stroke (symptomatic carotid stenosis). For both surgery and stenting, improvements in technique (and in medication) have reduced risk. Early studies showed that treating carotid narrowing by stenting, particularly for symptomatic lesions, caused more procedural minor strokes than surgery, but more recent trials in symptomatic and in asymptomatic patients found that both procedures might now be equally safe and effective. However, low patient numbers, short follow-up of the long-term effects on stroke rates and wide confidence intervals mean that worldwide uncertainty persists between carotid surgery and carotid stenting, and national and international guidelines remain unclear as to which is generally better.                                         Objectives               The second Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST-2) compares carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with carotid artery stenting (CAS) directly, randomising patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis for whom a carotid procedure is considered definitely necessary; both procedures seem anatomically feasible, and there is substantial uncertainty as to which of the two would be better for such individuals. Although it will compare procedural risks, the trial's primary aim is to compare the long-term durability of protection against strokes occurring in the years post procedure due to any remaining or recurrent carotid disease.

  abstract = {Background If carotid artery narrowing remains asymptomatic (ie, has caused no recent stroke or other neurological symptoms), successful carotid endarterectomy (CEA) reduces stroke incidence for some years. We assessed the long-term effects of successful CEA. Methods Between 1993 and 2003, 3120 asymptomatic patients from 126 centres in 30 countries were allocated equally, by blinded minimised randomisation, to immediate CEA (median delay 1 month, IQR 0{$\cdot$}3\textendash 2{$\cdot$}5) or to indefinite deferral of any carotid procedure, and were followed up until death or for a median among survivors of 9 years (IQR 6\textendash 11). The primary outcomes were perioperative mortality and morbidity (death or stroke within 30 days) and non-perioperative stroke. Kaplan-Meier percentages and logrank p values are from intention-to-treat analyses. This study is registered, number ISRCTN26156392. Findings 1560 patients were allocated immediate CEA versus 1560 allocated deferral of any carotid procedure. The proportions operated on while still asymptomatic were 89{$\cdot$}7\% versus 4{$\cdot$}8\% at 1 year (and 92{$\cdot$}1\% vs 16{$\cdot$}5\% at 5 years). Perioperative risk of stroke or death within 30 days was 3{$\cdot$}0\% (95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}4\textendash 3{$\cdot$}9; 26 non-disabling strokes plus 34 disabling or fatal perioperative events in 1979 CEAs). Excluding perioperative events and non-stroke mortality, stroke risks (immediate vs deferred CEA) were 4{$\cdot$}1\% versus 10{$\cdot$}0\% at 5 years (gain 5{$\cdot$}9\%, 95\% CI 4{$\cdot$}0\textendash 7{$\cdot$}8) and 10{$\cdot$}8\% versus 16{$\cdot$}9\% at 10 years (gain 6{$\cdot$}1\%, 2{$\cdot$}7\textendash 9{$\cdot$}4); ratio of stroke incidence rates 0{$\cdot$}54, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}43\textendash 0{$\cdot$}68, p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001. 62 versus 104 had a disabling or fatal stroke, and 37 versus 84 others had a non-disabling stroke. Combining perioperative events and strokes, net risks were 6{$\cdot$}9\% versus 10{$\cdot$}9\% at 5 years (gain 4{$\cdot$}1\%, 2{$\cdot$}0\textendash 6{$\cdot$}2) and 13{$\cdot$}4\% versus 17{$\cdot$}9\% at 10 years (gain 4{$\cdot$}6\%, 1{$\cdot$}2\textendash 7{$\cdot$}9). Medication was similar in both groups; throughout the study, most were on antithrombotic and antihypertensive therapy. Net benefits were significant both for those on lipid-lowering therapy and for those not, and both for men and for women up to 75 years of age at entry (although not for older patients). Interpretation Successful CEA for asymptomatic patients younger than 75 years of age reduces 10-year stroke risks. Half this reduction is in disabling or fatal strokes. Net benefit in future patients will depend on their risks from unoperated carotid lesions (which will be reduced by medication), on future surgical risks (which might differ from those in trials), and on whether life expectancy exceeds 10 years.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Previous clinical trials have suggested that carotid-artery stenting with a device to capture and remove emboli (``embolic protection'') is an effective alternative to carotid endarterectomy in patients at average or high risk for surgical complications. METHODS In this trial, we compared carotid-artery stenting with embolic protection and carotid endarterectomy in patients 79 years of age or younger who had severe carotid stenosis and were asymptomatic (i.e., had not had a stroke, transient ischemic attack, or amaurosis fugax in the 180 days before enrollment) and were not considered to be at high risk for surgical complications. The trial was designed to enroll 1658 patients but was halted early, after 1453 patients underwent randomization, because of slow enrollment. Patients were followed for up to 5 years. The primary composite end point of death, stroke, or myocardial infarction within 30 days after the procedure or ipsilateral stroke within 1 year was tested at a noninferiority margin of 3 percentage points. RESULTS Stenting was noninferior to endarterectomy with regard to the primary composite end point (event rate, 3.8\% and 3.4\%, respectively; P\,=\,0.01 for noninferiority). The rate of stroke or death within 30 days was 2.9\% in the stenting group and 1.7\% in the endarterectomy group (P\,=\,0.33). From 30 days to 5 years after the procedure, the rate of freedom from ipsilateral stroke was 97.8\% in the stenting group and 97.3\% in the endarterectomy group (P\,=\,0.51), and the overall survival rates were 87.1\% and 89.4\%, respectively (P\,=\,0.21). The cumulative 5-year rate of stroke-free survival was 93.1\% in the stenting group and 94.7\% in the endarterectomy group (P\,=\,0.44).

The proper treatment of patients with carotid bifurcation disease is of major interest to vascular surgeons and other vascular specialists. In 2011, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for the treatment of carotid artery disease. At the time, several randomized trials, comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS), were reported. Since the 2011 guidelines, several studies and a few systematic reviews comparing CEA and CAS have been reported, and the role of medical management has been reemphasized. In the present publication, we have updated and expanded on the 2011 guidelines with specific emphasis on five areas: (1) is CEA recommended over maximal medical therapy for low-risk patients; (2) is CEA recommended over transfemoral CAS for low surgical risk patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis of {$>$}50\%; (3) the timing of carotid intervention for patients presenting with acute stroke; (4) screening for carotid artery stenosis in asymptomatic patients; and (5) the optimal sequence of intervention for patients with combined carotid and coronary artery disease.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite level I evidence supporting a role for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the management of patients with asymptomatic carotid disease, there is surprisingly little international consensus regarding the optimal way to manage these patients. Methods: Review of current strategies for managing asymptomatic carotid disease Main findings: Those favouring a pro-interventional approach argue that: (i) until new randomised trials demonstrate that best medical therapy (BMT) is better than CEA or carotid artery stenting (CAS) in preventing stroke, guidelines of practice should remain unchanged; (ii) strokes secondary to carotid thromboembolism harboured a potentially treatable asymptomatic lesion prior to the event. Because 80\% of strokes are not preceded by a TIA/minor stroke, CEA/CAS is the only way of preventing these strokes; (iii) screening for carotid disease could identify patients with significant asymptomatic stenoses who could undergo prophylactic CEA/CAS in order to prevent avoidable stroke; (iv) international guidelines already advise that only `highly-selected' patients should undergo CEA/CAS; (v) the 30-day risks of death/stroke after CEA/CAS are diminishing and this will increase longterm stroke prevention and (vi) the alleged decline in annualized stroke rates in medically treated patients is based upon flawed data. Conclusions: The inescapable conclusion is that only a relatively small proportion of asymptomatic patients benefit from prophylactic CEA/CAS. The key question, therefore, remains; is society prepared to invest sufficient resources in identifying these `high risk for stroke' patients so that they can benefit from aggressive BMT and CEA or CAS, leaving the majority of lower risk patients to be treated medically? \textcopyright{} 2014 Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (Scottish charity number SC005317) and Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.

  abstract = {Background Statins reduce the incidence of strokes among patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease; whether they reduce the risk of stroke after a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) remains to be established. Methods We randomly assigned 4731 patients who had had a stroke or TIA within one to six months before study entry, had low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of 100 to 190 mg per deciliter (2.6 to 4.9 mmol per liter), and had no known coronary heart disease to double-blind treatment with 80 mg of atorvastatin per day or placebo. The primary end point was a first nonfatal or fatal stroke. Results The mean LDL cholesterol level during the trial was 73 mg per deciliter (1.9 mmol per liter) among patients receiving atorvastatin and 129 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter) among patients receiving placebo. During a median follow-up of 4.9 years, 265 patients (11.2 percent) receiving atorvastatin and 311 patients (13.1 percent) receiving placebo had a fatal or nonfatal stroke (5-year absolute reduction in risk, 2.2 percent; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to 0.99; P\,=\,0.03; unadjusted P\,=\,0.05). The atorvastatin group had 218 ischemic strokes and 55 hemorrhagic strokes, whereas the placebo group had 274 ischemic strokes and 33 hemorrhagic strokes. The five-year absolute reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events was 3.5 percent (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.92; P\,=\,0.002). The overall mortality rate was similar, with 216 deaths in the atorvastatin group and 211 deaths in the placebo group (P\,=\,0.98), as were the rates of serious adverse events. Elevated liver enzyme values were more common in patients taking atorvastatin.

Design: systematic review of 97 published studies following 8972 staged or synchronous operations. Results: mortality was highest in patients undergoing synchronous CEA  CABG (4.6\%, 95\% CI 4.1{$\pm$}5.2). Reverse staged procedures (CABG \`A CEA) were associated with the highest risk of ipsilateral stroke (5.8\%, 95\% CI 0.0{$\pm$}14.3) and any stroke (6.3\%, 95\% CI 1.0{$\pm$}11.7). Peri-operative myocardial infarction (MI) was lowest following the reverse staged procedure (0.9\%, 95\% CI 0.5{$\pm$}1.4) and highest in patients undergoing staged CEA \`A CABG (6.5\%, 95\% CI 3.2{$\pm$}9.7). The risk of death + any stroke was highest in patients undergoing synchronous CEA  CABG (8.7\%, 95\% CI 7.7{$\pm$}9.8) and lowest following staged CEA \`A CABG (6.1\%, 95\% CI 2.9{$\pm$}9.3). The risk of death/stroke or MI was 11.5\% (95\% CI 10.1{$\pm$}12.9) following synchronous procedures versus 10.2\% (95\% CI 7.4{$\pm$}13.1) after staged CEA then CABG. Conclusions: 10{$\pm$}12\% of patients undergoing staged or synchronous procedures suffered death or major cardiovascular morbidity (stroke, MI) within 30 days of surgery.

  abstract = {Objective: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases morbidity and mortality after vascular procedures and adversely affects late survival of patients. The presence of CKD also confers increased risk of stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Patients undergoing carotid intervention in the Vascular Study Group of New England database were stratified by CKD status referable to periprocedural and late outcomes. Methods: All carotid artery stenting and carotid endarterectomies (CEAs) performed from 2003 to 2013 were stratified by CKD severity as mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] {$>$}60 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR 30-59), and severe (eGFR {$<$}30). The impact of CKD on outcomes of carotid procedures was evaluated using univariate and multivariate methods. Results: Of 12,568 patients identified, 11,746 (93\%) underwent CEA and 822 (7\%) underwent carotid artery stenting. Procedures were performed for symptomatic disease in 40\%. CKD severity was mild in 58\%, moderate in 35\%, and severe in 7\%. The 30-day stroke rate was very low across all CKD groups (1.76\% mild vs 1.84\% moderate and 1.34\% severe; P [ .009). The 30-day mortality increased with worsening renal function (0.4\% mild vs 0.9\% moderate and 0.9\% severe; P [ .01). Independent predictors of 30-day stroke or death included American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 4 or 5 (odds ratio, 2.3; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-3.4; P [ .0001). Multivariable Cox hazards regression showed that severe CKD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.8; 95\% CI, 1.3-2.6), ASA class 4 or 5 (HR, 1.7; 95\% CI, 1.3-2.2), preoperative cortical symptoms (HR, 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.2-1.8), history of diabetes (HR, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.7), and age (HR, 1.03/y; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.04) independently (all P {$<$} .01) predicted neurologic events or death at median follow-up of 12.7 months (interquartile range, 10.3-15.2 months). CKD did not increase the risk of neurologic events at 1-year follow-up. Predictors (P {$<$} .05) of late death included moderate CKD (HR, 1.3; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.7), severe CKD (HR, 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.6-2.9), ASA class 4 or 5 (HR, 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.2-2.0), history of diabetes (HR, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.2-1.7), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.8), and cortical symptoms (HR, 1.3; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.6). The 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates decreased with worsening renal function (log-rank test, P {$<$} .001), but patients with severe CKD maintained a 71\% survival at 5 years. Conclusions: CKD severity increases risk of perioperative mortality as well as late mortality. Patients with CKD benefit from stroke-free survival especially after CEA. Unlike patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease, for whom severe CKD reduces median survival to w2.5 years, patients with CKD and carotid disease exhibit much longer survival. This suggests that carotid interventions have utility in carefully selected patients with moderate and severe CKD, particularly in symptomatic disease. (J Vasc Surg 2016;64:1295-302.)},

  abstract = {Objective: The incidence of carotid artery stenosis after head and neck radiation is anticipated to rise due to the increasing survival of patients with head and neck malignancies. It remains unclear whether carotid artery stenting (CAS) or endarterectomy (CEA) is the best treatment strategy for radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis. Materials \& Methods: This study was performed according to the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Eligible studies were identified through a comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Central until July 20, 2017. A meta-analysis of random effects model was conducted. The I-square statistic was used to assess for heterogeneity. Results: Five studies and 143 patients were included. Periprocedural stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) and death rates were similar between the two revascularization approaches. However, the risk for cranial nerve (CN) injury was higher in the CEA group (OR: 7.09; 95\% CI: 1.17 \textendash{} 42.88; I2 =0\%). CEA was associated with lower mortality rates after a mean follow-up of 50 months (OR: 0.29; 95\% CI: 0.09 \textendash{} 0.97; I2 =0\%). No difference was identified in long-term restenosis rates between CEA and CAS. Conclusions: Patients with radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis can safely undergo both CAS and CEA with similar risks of periprocedural stroke, MI and death. However, patients treated with CEA have a higher risk for periprocedural CN injuries and a lower risk for long-term mortality.},

The most frequent cause of the hemodynamic changes leading to VBI is atherosclerosis. The main clinical symptoms are dizziness, vertigo, headaches, vomit, diplopia, blindness, ataxia, imbalance, and weakness in both sides of the body. Even though arteriography is considered the most important exam to diagnose the disease, the inherent risks of this exam should be taken into consideration. The magnetic resonance angiography has been widely studied and is a good method to identify and localize any occlusions and stenosis in both neck and intracranial great vessels. ,  Conclusion {$\quad$}Each patient with a suspected diagnosis of VBI should be individually evaluated and treated, taking in consideration the pros and cons of each diagnostic testing and treatment option.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial, we found no significant difference between the stenting group and the endarterectomy group with respect to the primary composite end point of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death during the periprocedural period or any subsequent ipsilateral stroke during 4 years of follow-up. We now extend the results to 10 years. METHODS Among patients with carotid-artery stenosis who had been randomly assigned to stenting or endarterectomy, we evaluated outcomes every 6 months for up to 10 years at 117 centers. In addition to assessing the primary composite end point, we assessed the primary end point for the long-term extension study, which was ipsilateral stroke after the periprocedural period. RESULTS Among 2502 patients, there was no significant difference in the rate of the primary composite end point between the stenting group (11.8\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 9.1 to 14.8) and the endarterectomy group (9.9\%; 95\% CI, 7.9 to 12.2) over 10 years of follow-up (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95\% CI, 0.83 to 1.44). With respect to the primary long-term end point, postprocedural ipsilateral stroke over the 10-year follow-up occurred in 6.9\% (95\% CI, 4.4 to 9.7) of the patients in the stenting group and in 5.6\% (95\% CI, 3.7 to 7.6) of those in the endarterectomy group; the rates did not differ significantly between the groups (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95\% CI, 0.64 to 1.52). No significant between-group differences with respect to either end point were detected when symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients were analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS Over 10 years of follow-up, we did not find a significant difference between patients who underwent stenting and those who underwent endarterectomy with respect to the risk of periprocedural stroke, myocardial infarction, or death and subsequent ipsilateral stroke. The rate of postprocedural ipsilateral stroke also did not differ between groups.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for symptomatic stenosis of the internal carotid artery benefit from early intervention. Heterogeneous data are available on the influence of timing of carotid artery stenting (CAS) on procedural risk. Methods\textemdash We investigated the association between timing of treatment (0\textendash 7 days and {$>$}7 days after the qualifying neurological event) and the 30-day risk of stroke or death after CAS or CEA in a pooled analysis of individual patient data from 4 randomized trials by the Carotid Stenosis Trialists' Collaboration. Analyses were done per protocol. To obtain combined estimates, logistic mixed models were applied. Results\textemdash Among a total of 4138 patients, a minority received their allocated treatment within 7 days after symptom onset (14\% CAS versus 11\% CEA). Among patients treated within 1 week of symptoms, those treated by CAS had a higher risk of stroke or death compared with those treated with CEA: 8.3\% versus 1.3\%, risk ratio, 6.7; 95\% confidence interval, 2.1 to 21.9 (adjusted for age at treatment, sex, and type of qualifying event). For interventions after 1 week, CAS was also more hazardous than CEA: 7.1\% versus 3.6\%, adjusted risk ratio, 2.0; 95\% confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.7 (P value for interaction with time interval 0.06). Conclusions\textemdash In randomized trials comparing stenting with CEA for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, CAS was associated with a substantially higher periprocedural risk during the first 7 days after the onset of symptoms.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traumatic internal carotid artery dissection (CAD) has a potentially grave outcome. Anticoagulant therapy may be ineffective or contraindicated; surgery impractical. We present our experience with endovascular stenting in CAD patients. METHODS: From 2004 to 2011, 23 patients with angiographically proven traumatic CAD underwent endovascular stent-assisted arterial reconstruction based on clinical and radiographic criteria: contraindication or failure of anticoagulation, evidence of impending ischemic stroke, or need for urgent intracranial revascularization. Dissections were graded based on degree of stenosis and extent of injury. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (73.9\%) presented with stroke or transient ischemic attack. Carotid revascularization was achieved with one (11 patients, 48\%) or multiple stents (12 patients, 52\%); distal protection was used rarely (three patients, 13\%). No complications were directly attributed to stenting. Mean dissection-related stenosis improved from 72\% Ϯ 28.87\% to 4\% Ϯ 8.29\%. At a mean clinical follow-up of 28.7 months Ϯ 31.9 months, 16 patients (69.6\%) improved, six (26.1\%) remained stable, and one (4.3\%) had died secondary to multiple traumatic injuries. At long-term follow-up, no patient had a transient ischemic attack or stroke or presented evidence of de novo in-stent stenosis or stent thrombosis. There were no neurologic sequelae after partial or total discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy in seven patients undergoing trauma-related surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: Selected cases of traumatic CAD can be safely managed by endovascular stent-assisted angioplasty. Procedural complications are infrequent; the need for postprocedure antiplatelet therapy is a concern. Early detection is essential to avoid stroke. Stenting restores the integrity of the vessel lumen immediately, efficiently prevents the occurrence or recurrence of ischemic events, and avoids the need of long-term anticoagulation.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carotid and vertebral artery dissections are a leading cause of stroke in young individuals. OBJECTIVE: To examine the published safety and efficacy of endovascular stenting for extracranial artery dissection. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify all cases of endovascular management of extracranial carotid and vertebral artery dissections. RESULTS: For carotid dissections, our review yielded 31 published reports including 140 patients (153 vessels). Reported etiologies were traumatic (48\%, n = 64), spontaneous (37\%, n = 49), and iatrogenic (16\%, n = 21). The technical success rate of stenting was 99\%, and the procedural complication rate was 1.3\%. Mean angiographic follow-up was 12.8 months (range, 2-72 months) and revealed in-stent stenosis or occlusion in 2\% of patients. Mean clinical follow-up was 17.7 months (range, 1-72 months), and neurological events were seen in 1.4\% of patients. For vertebral artery dissections, our review revealed 8 reports including 10 patients (12 vessels). Etiologies were traumatic (60\%, n = 6), spontaneous (20\%, n = 2), and iatrogenic (20\%, n = 2). There was a 100\% technical success rate. The mean angiographic follow-up period was 7.5 months (range, 2-12 months). No new neurological events were reported during a mean clinical follow-up period of 26.4 months (range, 3-55 months). CONCLUSION: Endovascular management of extracranial arterial dissection continues to evolve. Current experience shows that this treatment option is safe and technically feasible. Prospective randomized trials compared with medical management are needed to further elucidate the role of stenting.},

  abstract = {Background: Subclavian artery revascularization is frequently performed in the setting of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). However, there is little information on the short- and long-term outcomes of patients undergoing carotid to subclavian artery bypass in this clinical setting. As such, this study sought to define the early and late outcomes associated with this procedure. Methods: Patients undergoing carotid-subclavian bypass in conjunction with TEVAR between June 2005 and September 2016 were retrospectively identified from a prospectively maintained, single-center aortic surgery database. The 30-day outcomes specific to the carotid-subclavian bypass procedure were analyzed, including cervical plexus nerve injury, bleeding complications, and local vascular complications. All preoperative and postoperative chest radiographs were carefully analyzed to assess for hemidiaphragm elevation indicative of phrenic nerve palsy. Long-term outcomes included primary graft patency and anastomotic complications. Results: Of 579 consecutive patients undergoing TEVAR during this time interval, 112 patients (19\%) underwent concomitant carotid-subclavian bypass. The cohort was 38\% female (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 43), with a mean age of 65 6 14 years. The majority of conduits were 8-mm polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 107 [95.5\%]), with a minority being reversed saphenous vein (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 4 [3.6\%]) or Dacron (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1 [0.9\%]) grafts. The bypass procedure was done concurrently at the time of TEVAR in 91\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 102) of cases. The short-term complication rate attributed specifically to the carotid-subclavian bypass was 29\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 33). These complications included phrenic nerve palsy in 25\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 27), recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy in 5\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 6), axillary nerve palsy in 2\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2), and neck hematoma requiring re-exploration in 1\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1) of patients. The 30-day in-hospital all-cause mortality rate was 5\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 6), and the rate of permanent paraparesis or paraplegia was 0.9\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1). Of the operative survivors (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 106), follow-up imaging of the bypass graft was available in 87\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 92) of patients. Actuarial primary graft patency was 97\% at 5 years. There were three patients (3\%) with bypass graft occlusions, two of which were clinically silent and detected on follow-up imaging. The third was detected because of symptoms of subclavian steal and required repeated revascularization. Two patients (2\%) developed a late anastomotic pseudoaneurysm requiring either endovascular (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1) or surgical (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1) intervention. Conclusions: Carotid-subclavian bypass for revascularization of the subclavian artery performed in the setting of TEVAR is durable, although the true complication rate is likely higher than is generally reported in the literature because of a not insignificant rate of phrenic nerve palsy. These data should serve well as ``gold standard'' comparison data for emerging branch graft devices. (J Vasc Surg 2019;69:701-9.)},

  abstract = {Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) consists of a group of distinct pathologies arising as a result of compression of structures at the thoracic outlet. The structures at risk are, from anterior to posterior, the subclavian vein, subclavian artery and brachial plexus. Compression or impingement causes venous (VTOS), arterial (ATOS) or neurogenic (NTOS) TOS. NTOS is the most common presentation, caused by compression of the brachial plexus at the scalene triangle or pectoralis minor space. Other compression syndromes at the carpal and cubital tunnels should be excluded. Management is usually conservative, employing physiotherapy and postural exercises, but pain or muscle wasting may be indications for surgery. VTOS is caused by compression of the subclavian vein at the costoclavicular junction, resulting in venous thrombosis, the Paget-Schroetter syndrome, often as a result of exercise in fit young muscular people or musicians. Positional swelling of the upper limb without thrombosis is termed McCleery's syndrome. In the presence of thrombosis, clot lysis, first rib excision and venoplasty may be indicated. ATOS occurs due to compression of the subclavian artery at the scalene triangle, often in association with an anomalous bony structure, such as cervical rib, causing post-stenotic aneurysmal dilation of the artery, thrombosis and embolization. Acute upper limb ischaemia necessitates urgent cervical rib excision and arterial reconstruction.},

METHODS: We generate strong (Grade 1) and weak (Grade 2) recommendations based on high- (Grade A), moderate- (Grade B), and low- (Grade C) quality evidence. RESULTS: For VTE and no cancer, as long-term anticoagulant therapy, we suggest dabigatran (Grade 2B), rivaroxaban (Grade 2B), apixaban (Grade 2B), or edoxaban (Grade 2B) over vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy, and suggest VKA therapy over low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; Grade 2C). For VTE and cancer, we suggest LMWH over VKA (Grade 2B), dabigatran (Grade 2C), rivaroxaban (Grade 2C), apixaban (Grade 2C), or edoxaban (Grade 2C). We have not changed recommendations for who should stop anticoagulation at 3 months or receive extended therapy. For VTE treated with anticoagulants, we recommend against an inferior vena cava filter (Grade 1B). For DVT, we suggest not using compression stockings routinely to prevent PTS (Grade 2B). For subsegmental pulmonary embolism and no proximal DVT, we suggest clinical surveillance over anticoagulation with a low risk of recurrent VTE (Grade 2C), and anticoagulation over clinical surveillance with a high risk (Grade 2C). We suggest thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism with hypotension (Grade 2B), and systemic therapy over catheter-directed thrombolysis (Grade 2C). For recurrent VTE on a non-LMWH anticoagulant, we suggest LMWH (Grade 2C); for recurrent VTE on LMWH, we suggest increasing the LMWH dose (Grade 2C). CONCLUSIONS: Of 54 recommendations included in the 30 statements, 20 were strong and none was based on high-quality evidence, highlighting the need for further research. CHEST 2016; 149(2):315-352},

  abstract = {Background: Most clinicians feel that treatment for patients with acute primary axillosubclavian vein thrombosis (``effort thrombosis'') is catheter-directed thrombolysis followed by thoracic outlet decompression. Several investigators feel that first rib resection (FRR) is not indicated in every case. No randomized data exist to answer this question. Methods: A MEDLINE search was done using the terms ``Paget-Schroetter syndrome,'' ``upper extremity DVT,'' ``first rib resection,'' ``effort thrombosis,'' and ``primary upper extremity thrombosis,'' with thrombolysis used as an ``AND'' term. We also specifically explored references cited to support either side of this argument in the past. Analysis was limited to patients aged 18 years or older with symptoms of 14-day duration or less undergoing thrombolysis for primary axillosubclavian vein thrombosis. Those studies that did not report follow-up, duplicate series from the same institution, and those in which patients were stented were excluded. Results were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis, with groups assigned according to each authors' prospectively described algorithm. Results: Twelve series were included. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to treatment after thrombolysis: FRR (448 patients), FRR plus endovenous balloon venoplasty (FRR + PLASTY; 68 patients), and those with no further intervention after thrombolysis (rib not removed; 168 patients). Symptom relief at last follow-up was significantly more likely in the FRR (95\%) and FRR + PLASTY (93\%) groups than in the rib not removed (54\%) group (both {$<$}0.0001) as was patency (98\%, 86\%, and 48\%, respectively; both {$<$}0.0001 vs. rib not removed). More than 40\% of patients in the rib not removed group eventually required rib resection for recurrent symptoms. No differences in symptom-free rates were seen when comparing FRR with FRR + PLASTY. Conclusions: In patients with acute effort thrombosis who undergo thrombolysis, permanent symptom relief and long-term patency are more likely to be achieved in patients who undergo FRR with or without endovenous balloon venoplasty than those whose rib is left intact.},

Heterogeneous data are available on the influence of timing of carotid artery stenting (CAS) on procedural risk. Methods\textemdash We investigated the association between timing of treatment (0\textendash 7 days and {$>$}7 days after the qualifying neurological event) and the 30-day risk of stroke or death after CAS or CEA in a pooled analysis of individual patient data from 4 randomized trials by the Carotid Stenosis Trialists' Collaboration. Analyses were done per protocol. To obtain combined estimates, logistic mixed models were applied. Results\textemdash Among a total of 4138 patients, a minority received their allocated treatment within 7 days after symptom onset (14\% CAS versus 11\% CEA). Among patients treated within 1 week of symptoms, those treated by CAS had a higher risk of stroke or death compared with those treated with CEA: 8.3\% versus 1.3\%, risk ratio, 6.7; 95\% confidence interval, 2.1 to 21.9 (adjusted for age at treatment, sex, and type of qualifying event). For interventions after 1 week, CAS was also more hazardous than CEA: 7.1\% versus 3.6\%, adjusted risk ratio, 2.0; 95\% confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.7 (P value for interaction with time interval 0.06). Conclusions\textemdash In randomized trials comparing stenting with CEA for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, CAS was associated with a substantially higher periprocedural risk during the first 7 days after the onset of symptoms. Early surgery is safer than stenting for preventing future stroke.},

  abstract = {Objective Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a clinical phenomenon resulting from compression of the neurovascular structures at the superior aperture of the thorax which presents with varying symptoms. Regarding to the varying symptoms, the diagnosis of TOS seems to be a challenge and predictors for the outcome are rare. The purpose of this study was therefore to analyze the different clinical examinations and tests relative to their prediction of the clinical outcome subsequent to surgery. Methods During a period of five years, 56 patients were diagnosed with TOS. Medical history, clinical tests, operative procedure and complications were recorded and analysed. Mean follow-up of the patients was 55.6 {$\pm$} 45.5 months, median age of the patients was 36.4 {$\pm$} 12.5 years. Results Different clinical tests for TOS showed an acceptable sensitivity overall, but a poor specificity. A positive test was not associated with a poor outcome. Analyses of the systolic blood pressure before and after exercise showed, that a distinct decrease in blood pressure of the affected side after exercises was associated with a poor outcome (p = 0.0027). Conclusions Clinical tests for TOS show a good sensitivity, but a poor specificity and cannot be used as predictors for the outcome. A distinct decrease in blood pressure of the affected side after exercises was associated with poor outcome and might be useful to predict the patients' outcome.},

  abstract = {Objective: To assess the results of physical therapy management and surgical treatment in a prospective observational cohort of patients with neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS) using patient-reported outcomes measures. Methods: Of 183 new patient referrals from July 1 to December 31, 2015, 150 (82\%) met the established clinical diagnostic criteria for NTOS. All patients underwent an initial 6-week physical therapy trial. Those with symptom improvement continued physical therapy, and the remainder underwent surgery (supraclavicular decompression with or without pectoralis minor tenotomy). Pretreatment factors and 7 patient-reported outcomes measures were compared between the physical therapy and surgery groups using t-tests and c2 analyses. Follow-up results were assessed by changes in 11-item version of Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) scores and patient-rated outcomes. Results: Of the 150 patients, 20 (13\%) declined further treatment or follow-up, 40 (27\%) obtained satisfactory improvement with physical therapy alone, and 90 (60\%) underwent surgery. Slight differences were found between the physical therapy and surgery groups in the mean 6 standard error degree of local tenderness to palpation (1.7 6 0.1 vs 2.0 6 0.1; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .032), the number of positive clinical diagnostic criteria (9.0 6 0.3 vs 10.1 6 0.1; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .001), Cervical-Brachial Symptom Questionnaire scores (68.0 6 4.1 vs 78.0 6 2.7; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .045), and Short-Form 12-item physical quality-of-life scores (35.6 6 1.5 vs 32.0 6 0.8; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .019) but not other pretreatment factors. During follow-up (median, 21.1 months for physical therapy and 12.0 months for surgery), the mean change in QuickDASH scores for physical therapy was \`A15.6 6 3.0 (\`A29.5\% 6 5.7\%) compared with \`A29.8 6 2.4 (\`A47.9\% 6 3.6\%) for surgery (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .001). The patient-rated outcomes for surgery were excellent for 27\%, good for 36\%, fair for 26\%, and poor for 11\%, with a strong correlation between the percentage of decline in the QuickDASH score and patient-rated outcomes (P {$<$} .0001). Conclusions: The present study has demonstrated contemporary outcomes for physical therapy and surgery in a wellstudied cohort of patients with NTOS, reinforcing that surgery can be effective when physical therapy is insufficient, even with substantial pretreatment disability. Substantial symptom improvement can be expected for w90\% of patients after surgery for NTOS, with treatment outcomes accurately reflected by changes in QuickDASH scores. Within this cohort, it was difficult to identify specific predictive factors for individuals most likely to benefit from physical therapy alone vs surgery. (J Vasc Surg 2019;70:832-41.)},

  abstract = {Objective: Surgical management of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS) is controversial due to the lack of predictors of success and difficulties in patient selection. We sought to examine the effects of patient demographics, etiology, duration of symptoms, and the selective use of lidocaine and botulinum toxin anterior scalene blocks on outcomes of patients undergoing transaxillary decompression with first rib resection and scalenotomy for NTOS. Methods: Patients with NTOS who had failed physical therapy and had transaxillary decompression between 2003 and 2009 were reviewed retrospectively from a prospectively maintained database. Patients were stratified to age groups {$<$}40 and {$>$}40 years old. Bivariate and multivariate statistical models of analysis were used. Results: One hundred fifty-nine procedures (16 patients bilateral; three patients with cervical ribs; 84.3\% women; median age, 37 years; range, 21-64 years) were identified. Ninety-six patients were {$<$}40 and 63 were {$>$}40 years old. Etiology was similar in both groups: trauma 43\% vs 46\% and chronic repetitive motion 57\% vs 54\%. Duration of symptoms was less in the {$<$}40 group (38.4 vs 66 months; P {$<$} .05). More patients in the {$>$}40 group had other spine, shoulder, or arm operations (38\% vs 18\%; P {$<$} .05). Median follow-up for the cohort was 12 months. Transaxillary decompression was more likely to relieve symptoms in patients {$<$}40 vs {$>$}40 years old (90\% vs 78\%; P {$<$} .05). Lidocaine blocks were positive in 89\% (49 of 55 patients) in the {$<$}40 group and 93\% (43 of 46 patients) in the {$>$}40 group. After adjusting for patient presenting factors in multivariate analysis, the impact of a successful lidocaine block in patients {$>$}40 years old was greater than in patients {$<$}40 years old (improvement of surgical success of 14\% in the {$>$}40 group vs 7\% in the {$<$}40 group; P ؍ .05). Botulinum toxin blocks were successful in less patients, 38\% (eight of 21 patients) in the {$<$}40 group and 52\% (12 of 23 patients) in the {$>$}40 group but were not predictive of symptom relief after transaxillary decompression. Conclusions: Although patients with NTOS {$<$}40 years old achieve more symptom relief overall after transaxillary decompression as compared to patients {$>$}40 years old, the selective use of lidocaine blocks is more beneficial in predicting surgical success in patients {$>$}40 years old given that younger patients {$<$}40 years old seem to do well regardless.

  abstract = {Objective: Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a rare condition characterized by subclavian artery pathology associated with a bony abnormality. This study assessed contemporary clinical management of arterial TOS at a highvolume referral center. Methods: A prospectively maintained database was used to conduct a retrospective review of patients undergoing primary or reoperative treatment for arterial TOS during an 8-year period (2008 to 2016). Presenting characteristics, operative findings, and clinical and functional outcomes were evaluated. Results: Forty patients underwent surgical treatment for arterial TOS, representing 3\% of 1401 patients undergoing operations for all forms of TOS during the same interval. Patients were a mean age of 40.3 6 2.2 years (range, 13-68 years), and 72\% were women. More than half presented with upper extremity ischemia/emboli (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 21) or posterior stroke (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2), including eight that had required urgent brachial artery thromboembolectomy. The presentation in 17 (42\%) was nonvascular, with 11 having symptoms of neurogenic TOS and six having an asymptomatic neck mass or incidentally discovered subclavian artery dilatation. All patients underwent thoracic outlet decompression (25 supraclavicular, 15 paraclavicular), of which there were 30 (75\%) with a cervical rib (24 complete, 6 partial), 5 with a first rib abnormality, 4 with a clavicle fracture, and 1 (reoperation) with no remaining bone abnormality. Subclavian artery reconstruction was performed in 70\% (26 bypass grafts, 1 patch, 1 suture repair), and 30\% had mild subclavian artery dilatation ({$<$}100\%) requiring no arterial reconstruction. Mean postoperative length of stay was 5.4 6 0.6 days. During a mean follow-up of 4.5 6 0.4 years (range, 0.98.1 years), subclavian artery patency was 92\%, none had further dilatation or embolism, and chronic symptoms were present in six (4 postischemic/vasospasm, 2 neurogenic). Functional outcomes measured by scores on the 11-item version of the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Outcome Measure improved from 39.1 6 3.8 to 19.2 6 2.7 (P {$<$} .0001). Conclusions: This relatively large single-institution series demonstrates the diverse clinical presentation of arterial TOS coincident with a spectrum of bony and arterial pathology. Current surgical protocols can achieve excellent outcomes for this rare and often complicated condition. (J Vasc Surg 2017;65:1429-39.)},

  abstract = {Objective: In the absence of ischemic events, arterial pathology at the thoracic outlet (TO) is rarely identified because findings of chronic arterial pathology may be masked by symptoms of neurogenic compression. This study describes the clinical presentations and significance of arterial compression at the TO. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of the clinical records and imaging studies of 41 patients with objective findings of arterial compression at the TO. Sixteen were diagnosed from 1990 to 2003, during which 284 patients underwent surgery for TO decompression with selective arterial imaging; 25 were diagnosed from 2003 to 2009, and 62 underwent TO surgical decompressions. Results: Subclavian artery stenosis, with or without poststenotic dilatation (PSD), was found in 26 patients (63\%), subclavian artery aneurysms in 12 (29\%), chronic subclavian occlusion in 1(2.4\%), and axillary artery compression in 2 (5\%). Chronic symptoms difficult to discern from neurogenic compression were present in 27 patients (66\%; 24 had subclavian stenoses or PSD, or both, 1 had subclavian occlusion, and 2 had axillary artery compression); 13 (32\%) presented with acute ischemia (11 had aneurysms and 2 had PSDs), and 1 asymptomatic patient had a subclavian aneurysm. Osteoarticular anomalies were found in 27 patients (66\%), including 19 cervical ribs, 4 first rib anomalies, and 4 clavicular or first rib fractures, or both. Among 27 patients with subclavian aneurysms or PSD, 21 (78\%) had a bone anomaly. Arterial pathology was deemed significant in 30 patients (73\%) and mild or moderate in 11 (21\%). Symptoms in 23 of these patients were compatible with neurogenic compression without clinical suspicion of arterial pathology, but 13 (56\%) harbored a significant arterial anomaly. Conclusions: The incidence of arterial pathology secondary to compression at the TO may be underestimated, and in the absence of obvious ischemia, significant arterial pathology may not be suspected. Two-thirds of patients with arterial compression have associated bone anomalies. Therefore, routine arterial imaging seems advisable for patients evaluated for TO syndrome in the presence of a bone anomaly at the TO or an examination that shows an arterial abnormality. In the absence of these signs, however, arterial pathology may be overlooked in patients with symptoms suggestive of neurogenic compression. Further study is needed to elucidate the incidence, natural history, and clinical relevance of arterial compression and PSD at the TO. ( J Vasc Surg 2010;52:406-11.)},

  abstract = {Introduction: Reviewed are the results of the emergent treatment of effort thrombosis of the subclavian vein. The protocol calls for immediate thrombolysis, followed by surgery at the time of the acute event. The one-stage procedure includes decompression of the thoracic inlet by subclavicular removal of the first rib, subclavius muscle, scalenectomy, and vein patch plasty of the stenotic segment of the vein. Methods: Between July 1985 through June 2006, 114 patients presented with Paget-Schroetter syndrome (effort thrombosis of the subclavian vein), 97 of which (group I) were seen {$<$}2 weeks of onset of symptoms. They underwent an emergent protocol treatment in which thrombolysis is immediately followed by surgery at the time of the acute event. In addition, another 17 patients (group II) were referred to our institution after being treated elsewhere with initial thrombolysis, but with surgery deferred a mean 34 days (range, 2 weeks to 3 months) after the initial event. All patients underwent the same lytic and surgical protocol. Operability was determined by the findings on the venogram. Routine postoperative anticoagulation for 8 weeks was implemented with warfarin and clopidogrel. Results: There was 100\% success in re-establishing the flow and normal caliber of the subclavian vein in the 97 patients in group I. Seven patients showed some residual stenosis that required balloon plasty and implant of a stent. Postoperative duplex ultrasound imaging documented patency in all 97 patients (100\%). The 17 patients with delayed surgery (group II) showed progression of the fibrosis, with vein obstruction in 12 (70\%). Only five patients (29\%) were operable with successful results. The remaining 12 patients were inoperable owing to extensive fibrosis and occlusion of the inflow, and all 12 have remained disabled for the use of their arm. Conclusions: The emergent approach to treat Paget-Schroetter syndrome seems to render the optimal results, with 100\% effectiveness in re-establishing venous flow and normal caliber to the vessel. When properly conducted, this operation avoids the use of stents or balloon plasty with excellent long-term results, leaving the patients unrestricted for physical activities.

  abstract = {Objectives: The results of treatment for subclavian vein effort thrombosis were assessed in a series of competitive athletes. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of high-performance athletes who underwent multidisciplinary management for venous thoracic outlet syndrome in a specialized referral center. The overall time required to return to athletic activity was assessed with respect to the timing and methods of diagnosis, initial treatment, operative management, and postoperative care. Results: Between January 1997 and January 2007, 32 competitive athletes (29 male and 3 female) were treated for venous thoracic outlet syndrome, of which 31\% were in high school, 47\% were in college, and 22\% were professional. The median age was 20.3 years (range, 16-26 years). Venous duplex ultrasound examination in 21 patients had a diagnostic sensitivity of 71\%, and the mean interval between symptoms and definitive venographic diagnosis was 20.2 ؎ 5.6 days (range, 1-120 days). Catheter-directed subclavian vein thrombolysis was performed in 26 (81\%), with balloon angioplasty in 12 and stent placement in one. Paraclavicular thoracic outlet decompression was performed with circumferential external venolysis alone (56\%) or direct axillary-subclavian vein reconstruction (44\%), using saphenous vein panel graft bypass (n ؍ 8), reversed saphenous vein graft bypass (n ؍ 3), and saphenous vein patch angioplasty (n ؍ 3). In 19 patients (59\%), simultaneous creation of a temporary (12 weeks) adjunctive radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula was done. The mean hospital stay was 5.2 ؎ 0.4 days (range, 2-11 days). Seven patients required secondary procedures. Anticoagulation was maintained for 12 weeks. All 32 patients resumed unrestricted use of the upper extremity, with a median interval of 3.5 months between operation and the return to participation in competitive athletics (range, 2-10 months). The overall duration of management from symptoms to full athletic activity was significantly correlated with the time interval from venographic diagnosis to operation (r ؍ 0.820, P {$<$} .001) and was longer in patients with persistent symptoms (P {$<$} .05) or rethrombosis before referral (P {$<$} .01). Conclusions: Successful outcomes were achieved for the management of effort thrombosis in a series of 32 competitive athletes using a multidisciplinary approach based on (1) early diagnostic venography, thrombolysis, and tertiary referral; (2) paraclavicular thoracic outlet decompression with external venolysis and frequent use of subclavian vein reconstruction; and (3) temporary postoperative anticoagulation, with or without an adjunctive arteriovenous fistula. Optimal outcomes for venous thoracic outlet syndrome depend on early recognition by treating physicians and prompt referral for comprehensive surgical management. ( J Vasc Surg 2008;47:809-21.)},

  abstract = {Background: Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) and its management are relatively controversial topics. Most of the literature reporting the outcomes of surgical decompression for TOS derives from single-center experiences. The objective of our study was to describe the current state of TOS surgery among hospitals that participate in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Methods: Our study sample consisted of patients from the 2005 to 2014 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database who underwent first or cervical rib resection as their index procedure and whose constellation of diagnosis and procedure codes identified them as having neurogenic, arterial, or venous TOS. Patient and procedure characteristics were determined, as were the 30-day incidence of specific complications including nerve injury. Multimodel inference was used for multivariable analysis of the composite outcome of readmission or reoperation \#30 days. Results: We identified 1431 patients undergoing operation for TOS: 83\% for neurogenic TOS, 3\% for arterial TOS, and 12\% for venous TOS. Vascular surgeons performed 90\% of procedures. Only four patients (0.3\%) demonstrated evidence of nerve injury. The rate of bleeding complication requiring transfusion was also quite low, at 1.4\%. The 30-day incidence of readmission or reoperation, or both, in our study cohort was 8.6\%. The risk of this outcome was increased in patients with a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification, those whose procedure was for non-neurogenic symptoms, and those whose procedure took longer to complete. Conclusions: The findings of our study will provide surgeons who advocate for the surgical management of TOS with reassurance that such intervention is associated with an extremely low risk of disability resulting from iatrogenic nerve injury and major bleeding events.

  abstract = {Subclavian artery stenosis has long been treated with great success with bypass surgery. Percutaneous intervention, often used in combination with stent placement, has come into vogue for the past few years as a safe and effective therapeutic modality. This study aimed to compare angioplasty alone with angioplasty followed by stent placement by combining available data. The objective of this study was to perform a review of the available literature to compare the efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) alone with PTA followed by stent placement for proximal subclavian artery stenosis. Successful recanalization was defined as patency at the end of 1 year, and reocclusions and restenoses were noted as events for the purpose of pooling the data. The authors searched the Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases for relevant trials/studies comparing PTA and PTA with stenting. Review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of studies (focusing on the adequacy of the randomization process, allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of follow-up, and intention-to-treat analysis) and selected studies for inclusion. All retrospective observational studies were also included in the analysis in the absence of doubleblinded randomized trials for increasing sample size. All analyses were done using RevMan 5.0. Odds ratio was calculated using Mantel\textendash Haenszel test with a fixed effect model. All included studies were assessed by all authors for potential sources of bias. Eight studies were included in the analysis having 544 participants. Stenting after PTA was significantly superior to angioplasty alone for treatment of subclavian artery stenosis and maintenance of patency at 1 year, as indicated by absence of events (P 5 0.004; 95\% confidence interval, odds ratio 2.37 [1.32\textendash 4.26]) without significant complication rates for either procedure. There is evidence in favor of stent placement after angioplasty for successful recanalization of stenosed subclavian arteries and long-term maintenance of patency without significant increase in risk for major complications in subjects.},

Methods\;and\;Results:\hspace{0.6em} We retrospectively analyzed all endovascular procedures of stenosis or occlusion of the subclavian or innominate artery between January 1990 and October 2013. During the observation period, a total of 130 procedures were attempted in 127 mostly symptomatic patients with stenosis (n=108; 83\%) or occlusion (n=22; 17\%) of the subclavian (n=119; 92\%) and innominate (n=11; 8\%) artery. The overall technical success rate was 97.7\% (n=127/130). Accounting for the type of lesion, the success rate for stenosis was 100\% (n=108/108) and for total occlusion, 86\% (n=19/22). The periprocedural complication rate was low and included stroke, transient ischemic attack, and access site complications of 0.8\%, 1.5\%, and 3.8\%, respectively. During a mean follow-up of 28 months the rate of restenosis ({$>$}70\%) was 12\%. Due to the overall low event rate no significant lesion or procedural risk factor for the development of restenosis could be identified. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Stenosis and occlusion of the subclavian and innominate artery can be treated safely and successfully by endovascular therapy with excellent long-term patency.\hspace{0.6em}\hspace{0.6em} (Circ J\hspace{0.6em}2015; 79: 537\,\textendash\,543)},

Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of PAA in patients with AAA, and to determine whether a certain risk factor profile is more commonly found in patients with concurrent aneurysms. All AAA patients (ICD code I71.3, I71.4) attending the outpatient clinic at the Karolinska University Hospital between 2011 and 2013 were included in the study cohort (n=465); 48\% (225) had been subjected to an ultrasound or computed tomography scan of their popliteal arteries. In these patients, three definitions of PAA were considered (? 10.5, ? 12, ? 15 mm), although the overall analysis is based on PAA ? 12 mm. The mean age was 70.7 years (SD 7.5), 89\% were men, and the mean AAA diameter was 47 mm (SD 14). The prevalence of PAA was 19\% (n=43) by definition ? 12 mm, and 11\% (n=25) with 15 mm. Claudication was more frequently found in AAA patients with PAA than patients without PAA. Sensitivity between clinical examination and radiology was 26\%, and the specificity for clinical examination was 90\%. In conclusion, owing to the high prevalence of PAA in AAA patients, described by us and others, the low cost and risks associated with ultrasound and the poor sensitivity at clinical examination, all women and men with AAA should undergo one radiological examination of their popliteal arteries.},

  abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of femoral and popliteal aneurysms in men and women who have abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and to assess potential etiologic differences in patients with and without these lower extremity aneurysms. Methods: We studied 313 consecutive patients with AAAs encountered from 1995 to 1998 who underwent prospective ultrasound scanning to detect the presence or absence of femoral and popliteal aneurysms. Patients with and without these extremity aneurysms were compared for differences in potential etiologic risk factors with each other and with a statewide population of patients with AAAs. Results: A total of 51 femoral and popliteal aneurysms were encountered, all occurring in male patients. Among the 251 men with AAAs, the incidence of femoral or popliteal aneurysms was 14\%, compared with 0\% among the 62 women with AAAs (P {$<$} .01). A family history of aneurysmal disease was present in only one (3\%) of the 36 men with these extremity arterial aneurysms, a significant finding (P {$<$} .01) when compared with the family history that was positive for aneurysmal disease in 14 women (23\%). Peripheral arterial occlusive disease affected 14 (39\%) of the 36 men with peripheral arterial aneurysms versus 20 (9\%) of the 215 men without these aneurysms (P {$<$} .01). Most other etiologic variables studied proved not to be different among the various groups of patients examined. Conclusion: The incidence of femoral and popliteal aneurysms in persons with AAAs appears higher than that noted previously. Femoral and popliteal aneurysmal disease preferentially affects men; however, the basis for this sex difference is unknown. Few common etiologic factors differed between men with and without these extremity aneurysms. Most femoral and popliteal artery aneurysms in this study were undetectable on physical examination, suggesting that ultrasound scanning is appropriate in the recognition of peripheral aneurysms among men with AAAs.

  abstract = {Background Decision-making related to the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is complex. Aneurysms present with varying risks of rupture, and patient-specific factors influence anticipated life expectancy, operative risk, and need to intervene. Careful attention to the choice of operative strategy along with optimal treatment of medical comorbidities is critical to achieving excellent outcomes. Moreover, appropriate postoperative surveillance is necessary to minimize subsequent aneurysm-related death or morbidity. Methods The committee made specific practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Three systematic reviews were conducted to support this guideline. Two focused on evaluating the best modalities and optimal frequency for surveillance after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). A third focused on identifying the best available evidence on the diagnosis and management of AAA. Specific areas of focus included (1) general approach to the patient, (2) treatment of the patient with an AAA, (3) anesthetic considerations and perioperative management, (4) postoperative and long-term management, and (5) cost and economic considerations. Results Along with providing guidance regarding the management of patients throughout the continuum of care, we have revised a number of prior recommendations and addressed a number of new areas of significance. New guidelines are provided for the surveillance of patients with an AAA, including recommended surveillance imaging at 12-month intervals for patients with an AAA of 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter. We recommend endovascular repair as the preferred method of treatment for ruptured aneurysms. Incorporating knowledge gained through the Vascular Quality Initiative and other regional quality collaboratives, we suggest that the Vascular Quality Initiative mortality risk score be used for mutual decision-making with patients considering aneurysm repair. We also suggest that elective EVAR be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality and conversion rate to open surgical repair of 2\% or less and that perform at least 10 EVAR cases each year. We also suggest that elective open aneurysm repair be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality of 5\% or less and that perform at least 10 open aortic operations of any type each year. To encourage the development of effective systems of care that would lead to improved outcomes for those patients undergoing emergent repair, we suggest a door-to-intervention time of {$<$}90 minutes, based on a framework of 30-30-30 minutes, for the management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm. We recommend treatment of type I and III endoleaks as well as of type II endoleaks with aneurysm expansion but recommend continued surveillance of type II endoleaks not associated with aneurysm expansion. Whereas antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for patients with an aortic prosthesis before any dental procedure involving the manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended before respiratory tract procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures, and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures unless the potential for infection exists or the patient is immunocompromised. Increased utilization of color duplex ultrasound is suggested for postoperative surveillance after EVAR in the absence of endoleak or aneurysm expansion. Conclusions Important new recommendations are provided for the care of patients with an AAA, including suggestions to improve mutual decision-making between the treating physician and the patients and their families as well as a number of new strategies to enhance perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing elective and emergent repair. Areas of uncertainty are highlighted that would benefit from further investigation in addition to existing limitations in diagnostic tests, pharmacologic agents, intraoperative tools, and devices.},

Although much is known about intervention at 5.5 cm, little is known about the fate of the patient unfit for elective surgery at this threshold. Medical therapy and endovascular surgery have revolutionized management of aortic aneurysms in the last 20 years and are thought to have affected rupture rates. Methods: MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library Database were searched for studies reporting follow-up of untreated large AAA approach from inception to January 2014. Data were pooled using random-effects analysis with standardized mean differences and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) reported. The primary end points were rupture rates and all-cause mortality per year by AAA size. Results: The search strategy identified 1892 citations, of which 11 studies comprising 1514 patients experiencing 347 ruptured AAA were included. The overall incidence of ruptured AAA in patients with AAA {$>$}5.5 cm was 5.3\% (95\% CI, 3.1\%-7.5\%) per year. This represented cumulative yearly rupture rates of 3.5\% (95\% CI, L1.6\% to 8.7\%) in AAAs 5.5 to 6.0 cm, 4.1\% (95\% CI, L0.7\% to 9.0\%) in AAAs 6.1 to 7.0 cm, and 6.3\% (95\% CI, L1.8\% to 14.3\%) in AAAs {$>$}7.0 cm. There was no heterogeneity between studies (I2 [ 0\%). Only 32\% of these patients were offered repair on rupturing an AAA, with a perioperative mortality of 58\% (95\% CI, 32\%-83\%). The risk of death from causes other than AAA was higher than the risk of death from rupture. Conclusions: Rupture rates of untreated AAA were lower than those currently quoted in the literature. Non-AAA-related mortality in this group of patients is high. (J Vasc Surg 2015;61:1606-12.)},

  abstract = {Background: To evaluate abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) morphology in a cohort of patients presenting with ruptured AAA (rAAA) and to explore if aneurysms with diameters below the recommended threshold for elective repair ({$<$}55 mm) have some distinctive morphological characteristics. Methods: All patients diagnosed with rAAA using computed tomography (CT) scans between January 2006 and June 2013 were eligible for this study. Where CT scans of acceptable quality were available, images were reconstructed in a dedicated three-dimensional vascular workstation for evaluation of aneurysm diameters and morphology. All morphological characteristics were defined according to the reporting standards for endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. Additionally, fusiform AAAs were defined as aneurysms involving the whole circumference of the aortic wall and saccular AAAs as spherical aneurysms involving only a portion of the aortic circumference. Results: A total of 248 patients were identified. Of those, 83\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 206) had high-quality CT scans available and were included in the study. Patients were on average 75 years old and 85\% were men. Mean aneurysm diameter was 76 {$\pm$} 14 mm and 95\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 197) had fusiform morphology. Six percent (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 12) were {$<$}55 mm and those included all saccular aneurysms in women (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 3) and 22\% of saccular aneurysms in men (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2). The remaining saccular aneurysms (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 4) were small with a maximal diameter of 56 mm. Aneurysms {$<$}55 mm had less angulated proximal necks than their larger counterparts (P {$<$} 0.01). No other morphological differences were found between the groups. Conclusions: Ruptured aneurysms are often large and the 55 mm threshold for elective repair is probably appropriate. However, approximately 6\% of rAAAs are {$<$}55 mm, with a significant portion being saccular, especially in women. Morphological assessment of AAAs with CT scans should be considered in small aneurysms (40e55 mm), particularly in women, to exclude saccular morphology before continued ultrasound surveillance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Elective endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm results in lower perioperative mortality than traditional open repair, but after 4 years this survival advantage is not seen; in addition, results of two European trials have shown worse long-term outcomes with endovascular repair than with open repair. Long-term results of a study we conducted more than a decade ago to compare endovascular repair with open repair are unknown. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms to either endovascular repair or open repair of the aneurysm. All the patients were candidates for either procedure. Patients were followed for up to 14 years. RESULTS A total of 881 patients underwent randomization: 444 were assigned to endovascular repair and 437 to open repair. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. A total of 302 patients (68.0\%) in the endovascular-repair group and 306 (70.0\%) in the open-repair group died (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.13). During the first 4 years of follow-up, overall survival appeared to be higher with endovascular repair than with open repair; from year 4 through year 8, overall survival was higher in the open-repair group; and after 8 years, overall survival was once again higher in the endovascular-repair group (hazard ratio for death, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.74 to 1.18). None of these trends were significant. There were 12 aneurysm-related deaths (2.7\%) in the endovascular-repair group and 16 (3.7\%) in the open-repair group (between-group difference, -1.0 percentage point; 95\% CI, -3.3 to 1.4); most deaths occurred during the perioperative period. Aneurysm rupture occurred in 7 patients (1.6\%) in the endovascular-repair group, and rupture of a thoracic aneurysm occurred in 1 patient (0.2\%) in the open-repair group (betweengroup difference, 1.3 percentage points; 95\% CI, 0.1 to 2.6). Death from chronic obstructive lung disease was just over 50\% more common with open repair (5.4\% of patients in the endovascular-repair group and 8.2\% in the open-repair group died from chronic obstructive lung disease; between-group difference, -2.8 percentage points; 95\% CI, -6.2 to 0.5). More patients in the endovascular-repair group underwent secondary procedures. CONCLUSIONS Long-term overall survival was similar among patients who underwent endovascular repair and those who underwent open repair. A difference between groups was noted in the number of patients who underwent secondary therapeutic procedures. Our results were not consistent with the findings of worse performance of endovascular repair with respect to long-term survival that was seen in the two European trials.

  abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare findings at presentation and surgical outcomes in patients in whom abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) ruptured after endovascular repair and in patients in whom AAAs ruptured before any treatment during a defined period at a single center. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who presented to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital with ruptured AAA from September 2003 to September 2014. Medical records of each patient were reviewed to retrieve demographics, findings at presentation, and surgical outcome. Comparison of the outcomes between those occurring after endovascular repair (group 1) and those occurring without previous endovascular treatment (group 2) was made using the data collected and combining the results obtained by a previous study that analyzed the same findings between 1992 and 2003 from the same center to provide a total 22-year experience (1992-2014) at a single quaternary referral center. Results: From May 1992 to September 2014, there were 1921 elective repairs of intact infrarenal AAAs, with 1288 endovascular and 633 open repairs. During 22 years, 40 of the 1288 patients (3.1\%) who underwent endovascular repair for AAA had rupture. The proportion of patients with hypotension at presentation in group 1 (13/40) was significantly less than in group 2 (108/138; P {$<$} .01). The difference in perioperative 30-day mortality rate in group 1 (8/40 [20\%]) compared with group 2 (68/138 [49\%]) was significant (P {$<$} .01). Conclusions: This study confirmed that endovascular AAA repair does not prevent rupture in all patients. The data suggest that rupture, when it does occur, may not be accompanied by such major hemodynamic changes and higher mortality rate as with rupture of an untreated AAA. Strict surveillance and follow-up are required, especially in patients with relatively large initial AAA diameter or presence of endoleak and graft migration, to reduce the rate of ruptures after endovascular repair. Complete prevention will remain challenging because rupture may occur without any predisposing abnormalities. With the advent of new-generation devices, continuous larger long-term studies are required to document reduction in rupture rates after endovascular aneurysm repair. (J Vasc Surg 2017;65:52-7.)},

  abstract = {Background: Open repair (OR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is a major surgical procedure with elevated morbidity and a low but definite mortality. Advocates of endovascular repair (EVAR) claim decreased complication rates and outcome equal to OR. Methods: Data of all patients with infrarenal AAA that was treated electively, both with OR and EVAR, at Mayo Clinic Rochester between December 1, 1999 and December 1, 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. Thirty-day morbidity and mortality and early clinical outcomes were assessed and compared. Results: Three hundred fifty-five patients underwent treatment: 261 patients, including 229 males and 32 females (mean age: 73 years; range: 52 to 90 years) underwent OR, and 94 patients including 85 males and 9 females (mean age: 77 years; range: 61 to 98 years) underwent EVAR (AneuRx: 53, Ancure: 38, Endologix: 3). Median AAA size was 57 mm in both groups. There were more high-risk patients in the EVAR group (27\% vs 14\%, P ؍ .007). Thirty-day mortality rates were 1.1 \% (3/261) for OR and 0 for EVAR (P ؍ NS). Cardiac and pulmonary complications were less frequent after EVAR (11\% vs 22\%, P ؍ .02, and 3\% vs 16\%, P ؍ .001, respectively), but graft-related complications were more frequent (13\% vs 4\%, P ؍ .002). The association between type of repair and cardiac, pulmonary, and graft complications remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, gender, and high-risk status. The multivariate odds ratios (EVAR vs OR) for cardiac, pulmonary, and graft complications were 0.35 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17 to 0.74), 0.14 (95\% CI: 0.04 to 0.47), and 3.81 (95\% CI: 1.51 to 9.58), respectively. Primary and secondary patency and freedom-fromreintervention rates at 1 year were lower after EVAR (83\% vs 98\%, P {$<$} .001; 96\% vs 99\%, P ؍ .02; 65\% vs 93\%, P {$<$} .001, respectively). Conclusions: Both elective OR and EVAR can be performed with low mortality, but cardiac and pulmonary complications are less frequent and less severe after EVAR. The tradeoff of EVAR is a higher rate of graft-related complications, with more reinterventions and a lower graft patency rate at 1 year. These results should be considered before EVAR is offered to patients with AAA. (J Vasc Surg 2004;39:497-505.)},

  abstract = {Background: Ischemic colitis after an open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair remains a serious complication with a nationally reported rate of 1\% to 6\% in elective cases and up to 60\% after an aneurysmal rupture. To prevent this serious complication, inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) replantation is performed at the discretion of the surgeon based on his or her intraoperative findings, despite the lack of clear evidence to support this practice. The purpose of this study was to determine whether replantation of the IMA reduces the risk of ischemic colitis and improves the overall outcome of AAA repair. Methods: Patients who underwent open infrarenal AAA repair were identified in the multicenter American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Targeted AAA Database from 2012 to 2015. Emergency cases, patients with chronically occluded IMAs, ruptured aneurysms with evidence of hypotension, and patients requiring visceral revascularization were excluded. The remaining elective cases were divided into two groups: those with IMA replantation (IMA-R) and those with IMA ligation. We measured the 30-day outcomes including mortality, morbidity, and perioperative outcomes. A multivariable logistic regression model was used for data analysis, adjusting for clinically relevant covariates. Results: We identified 2397 patients who underwent AAA repair between 2012 and 2015, of which 135 patients (5.6\%) had ischemic colitis. After applying the appropriate exclusion criteria, there were 672 patients who were included in our study. This cohort was divided into two groups: 35 patients with IMA-R and 637 patients with IMA ligation. There were no major differences in preoperative comorbidities between the two groups. IMA-R was associated with increased mean operative time (319.7 6 117.8 minutes vs 242.4 6 109.3 minutes; P {$<$} .001). Examination of 30-day outcomes revealed patients with IMA-R had a higher rate of return to the operating room (20.0\% vs 7.2\%; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .006), a higher rate of wound complications (17.1\% vs 3.0\%; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .001), and a higher incidence of ischemic colitis (8.6\% vs 2.4\%; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .027). There were no significant differences in mortality, pulmonary complications, or renal complications between the two groups. In multivariable analysis, IMA-R was a significant predictor of ischemic colitis and wound complications. Conclusions: These data suggest that IMA-R is not associated with protection from ischemic colitis after open AAA repair. The role of IMA-R remains to be identified. (J Vasc Surg 2019;69:1825-30.)},

A total of 24 (1.1\%) patients had overt intestinal ischemia, documented by reoperation or endoscopic findings. Of these, colon ischemia occurred in 19 (0.9\%) and small bowel ischemia developed in 5 (0.2\%) patients. The incidence after elective operation for aneurysmal or occlusive disease did not differ, but patients with ruptured aneurysms and those undergoing reoperative procedures for total graft replacement were at higher risk. Preoperative angiography was most helpful in ascertaining risk. Ligation of a patent inferior mesenteric artery was the most common (74\%) feature in patients with colon ischemia. With preexisting inferior mesenteric artery occlusion, impairment of collateral circulation was attributable to superior mesenteric artery disease, dissection or retractor injury, prior colon resection, or exclusion of hypogastric perfusion. Bloody diarrhea was the most frequent postoperative symptom and colonoscopy the most reliable means of diagnosis. One half of patients with colon ischemia required resection after late recognition of perforation. All cases of small bowel ischemia were related to superior mesenteric artery disease or injury or use of suprarenal clamping. The overall mortality rate was 25\% but rose to 50\% if bowel resection was required. Intestinal ischemia remains an infrequent but serious complication of aortic surgery. Despite a multifactorial cause, identification of patients at increased risk can lead to operative strategies to reduce its occurrence.},

We sought to evaluate the rate of compliance with imaging follow-up post EVAR and to identify factors associated with being lost to imaging follow-up. Methods We identified a 20\% sample of continuously enrolled Medicare beneficiaries who underwent EVAR between 2001 and 2008. Using data through 2010 from Medicare Inpatient, Outpatient, and Carrier files, we identified all abdominal imaging studies that may have been performed for EVAR follow-up. Patients were considered lost to annual imaging follow-up if they did not undergo any abdominal imaging study within their last two years of follow-up. Multivariable models were constructed to identify independent factors associated with being lost to annual imaging follow-up. Results Among 19,962 patients who underwent EVAR, the incidence of loss to annual imaging follow-up at 5 years post EVAR was 50\%. Primary factors associated with being lost to annual imaging follow-up were advanced age (age 65-69 years, reference, age 75-79, HR, 1.23 [95\% CI, 1.15-1.32]), (age 80-85, HR, 1.45, [95\% CI 1.35-1.55]), (age {$>$}85, HR 2.03, [95\% CI 1.88-2.20]) and presentation with an urgent/emergent intact aneurysm (HR, 1.27 [95\% CI, 1.20-1.35]) or ruptured aneurysm (HR, 1.84 [95\% CI, 1.63-2.08]). Additional independent factors included several previously diagnosed chronic diseases and South and West regions of the US. Conclusions Annual imaging follow-up compliance post EVAR in the United States is significantly below recommended levels. Quality improvement efforts to encourage improved compliance with imaging follow-up, especially in older patients with multiple comorbidities and in those who underwent EVAR urgently or for rupture, are necessary.},

  abstract = {Background: The incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and their rupture has been reported to be decreasing. The aim was to evaluate trends in ruptured AAA (rAAA) incidence in the hospital district of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS) in southern Finland. This was a population-based retrospective review of all patients with rAAA in this well defined geographical area during 2003\textendash 2013. Methods: Data for all patients treated for rAAA at Helsinki University Hospital, the only vascular surgery centre in an area of 1{$\cdot$}5 million inhabitants, were collected from local vascular registry. All deaths attributed to rAAA were obtained from the cause of death registry of Statistics Finland. Results: The mean(s.d.) age of the 712 patients with rAAA was 76{$\cdot$}5(9{$\cdot$}6) years; 76{$\cdot$}7 per cent of them were men. Only 330 patients (46{$\cdot$}3 per cent of those with rAAA) arrived alive at Helsinki University Hospital. The turn-down rate for surgical treatment was 10{$\cdot$}3 per cent. Of the 296 patients operated on, 199 (67{$\cdot$}2 per cent) were alive at 30 days. Only 27{$\cdot$}9 per cent of all patients were alive 30 days after rupture of the AAA. The incidence of rAAA was 4{$\cdot$}3 per 100 000 inhabitants and the mortality rate was 3{$\cdot$}2 per 100 000 inhabitants. A decreasing trend was seen in incidence and mortality during the 11-year study interval. Conclusion: The incidence of rAAA is decreasing in the HUS district. Mortality from rAAA remains very high, because half of the patients die before reaching the hospital.

  abstract = {Introduction Previous studies have found conflicting results regarding the operative risks associated with conversion to open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair after failed endovascular treatment (EVAR). The purpose of this study was to assess the outcome of patients undergoing a conversion, and compare outcomes to standard open AAA repair and EVAR. Additionally, we sought out to identify factors associated with conversion. Methods All patients undergoing a conversion to open repair, and those undergoing standard EVAR and open repair between 2005 and 2013 were included from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with conversion, and to assess independent perioperative risks associated with conversion compared to standard AAA repair. Subanalysis for factors associated with conversion was performed among patients additionally included in the more detailed Targeted Vascular Module of the NSQIP. Results A total of 32,164 patients were included, with 300 conversions, 7188 standard open repairs, and 24,676 EVARs. Conversion to open repair was associated with a significantly higher 30-day mortality than standard open repair (10.0\% vs. 4.2\%, P{$<$}.001, OR: 2.4, 95\% CI: 1.6 \textendash{} 3.6), and EVAR (10.0\% vs. 1.7\%, P{$<$}.001, OR: 7.2, 95\% CI: 4.8 \textendash{} 10.9). Conversion surgery was additionally followed by an increased occurrence of any complication (OR: 1.5, 95\% CI: 1.2 \textendash{} 1.9 (open); OR: 7.8, 95\% CI: 6.1 \textendash{} 9.9 (EVAR)). Factors associated with conversion were young age (OR: 1.2 per 10 years decrease, 95\% CI: 1.1 \textendash{} 1.4), female gender (OR: 1.5, 95\% CI: 1.2 \textendash{} 2.0), and non-white race (OR: 1.8, 95\% CI: 1.3 \textendash{} 2.6). Conversely, BMI {$>$} 30 was negatively associated with (OR: 0.7, 95\% CI: 0.5 \textendash{} 0.9). Among anatomic characteristics captured in the Targeted Vascular data set (N=4555), aneurysm large diameter demonstrated to be strongly associated with conversion (OR: 1.1 per 1 cm increase, 95\% CI: 1.03 \textendash{} 1.1). Conclusion Conversion to open repair after failed EVAR is associated with substantially increased perioperative morbidity and mortality compared to standard AAA repair. Factors associated with conversion are large diameter of the aneurysm, young age, female gender, and non-white race, while obesity is inversely related to conversion surgery.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS \textemdash{} Potential risk factors for the development of PVD were examined in 3,834 of 5,102 individuals enrolled in the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) without PVD at diagnosis of diabetes, followed for 6 years, and for whom relevant data were available. PVD was defined as two of the following: ankle-arm blood pressure index Ͻ0.8, absence of both dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses to palpation in one or both legs, and intermittent claudication. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between potential risk factors measured 3\textendash{} 4 months after diagnosis of diabetes and incident PVD. The prevalence of PVD at 3-year intervals to 18 years was determined. RESULTS \textemdash{} Hyperglycemia, assessed as HbA1c, was associated with an increased risk for incident PVD, independent of other risk factors including age, increased systolic blood pressure, reduced HDL cholesterol, smoking, prior cardiovascular disease, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and retinopathy. Each 1\% increase in HbA1c was associated with a 28\% increased risk of PVD (95\% CI 12\textendash{} 46), and each 10-mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure with a 25\% increase in risk (95\% CI 10 \textendash{} 43). CONCLUSIONS \textemdash{} Hyperglycemia, as well as smoking, dyslipidemia, and blood pressure are potentially modifiable risk factors for the development of PVD.},

The incidence increased sharply with age until the age of 75, with about a twofold male predominance at all ages. An incidence of IC comparable to that of angina pectoris was obtained ten years later in life than for angina pectoris. Cigarette smoking, impaired glucose tolerance, and hypertension were powerful predisposing factors. Impaired glucose tolerance was a greater risk in women than in men, and glycosuria carried a greater risk than other indicators of impaired glucose tolerance. Cigarette smoking had about the same impact in men and women, approximately doubling the risk, and the impact was discernible into advanced age. Hypertension increased risk 2.5- to fourfold, respectively, in men and women. A low vital capacity was associated with a substantial excess risk. Electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy predicted IC in both sexes. Serum cholesterol, relative weight, and hematocrit were weak risk factors. A risk profile made up of the major cardiovascular risk factors was better for predicting IC than for predicting coronary heart disease. Mortality was increased two- to fourfold in men and women, respectively, mainly because of coexistent cardiovascular disease.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The Heart Protection Study (HPS) provides an opportunity to assess directly the effects of cholesterol-lowering therapy on major vascular events (defined as myocardial infarction, coronary death, stroke, or revascularization) in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In addition, the effects on peripheral vascular events (ie, non-coronary revascularization, aneurysm repairs, major amputations or PAD deaths) can be assessed. Methods: 6748 UK adults with PAD and 13,788 other high-risk participants were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily or matching placebo, yielding an average LDL cholesterol difference of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during a mean of 5 years. Results: For participants with PAD, allocation to simvastatin was associated with a highly significant 22\% (95\% CI 15-29) relative reduction in the rate of first major vascular event following randomisation (895 [26.4\%] simvastatin-allocated vs 1101 [32.7\%] placebo-allocated; P {$<$} .0001), which was similar to that seen among the other high-risk participants. The absolute reduction in first major vascular event was 63 (SE 11) per 1000 patients with PAD and 50 (SE 7) per 1000 without pre-existing PAD. Overall, among all participants, there was a 16\% (5-25) relative reduction in the rate of first peripheral vascular event following randomisation (479 [4.7\%] simvastatin vs 561 [5.5\%] placebo), largely irrespective of baseline LDL cholesterol and other factors. This effect chiefly reflects a 20\% (8-31) relative reduction in non-coronary revascularization procedures (334 [3.3\%] vs 415 [4.0\%]; P ؍ .002). Conclusion: HPS demonstrates the benefits of cholesterol-lowering statin therapy in patients with PAD, regardless of their presenting cholesterol levels and other presenting features. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduces the rate of first major vascular events by about one-quarter, and that of peripheral vascular events by about one-sixth, with large absolute benefits seen in participants with PAD because of their high vascular risk. Consequently, statin therapy should be considered routinely for all patients with PAD. ( J Vasc Surg 2007;45:645-54.)},

BACKGROUND Previous reports have found a significant difference in the risk of PAD by ethnic group, with some of the risk difference attributed to different levels of traditional CVD risk factors. METHODS A total of 6,814 individuals free of clinically apparent CVD were enrolled in the MESA (Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) and underwent standardized testing for the presence of PAD by the ankle-brachial index. These subjects also had fasting blood drawn for serum cholesterol, glucose, and a number of novel biomarkers for CVD. Non-Hispanic whites were the largest ethnic group (38\%), followed by African Americans (28\%), Hispanics (22\%), and Chinese (12\%). RESULTS In this cross-sectional analysis, 6,653 subjects with an ankle brachial index Ͻ1.40 were analyzed. The mean (SD) age was 62.2 (10.2) years, and 52.9\% were women. Interleukin-6, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and homocysteine were significantly associated with PAD after adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors. Compared with non-Hispanic whites and after adjustment for traditional and ``novel'' risk factors, the odds for PAD were 1.47 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07 to 2.02) times higher in African Americans, while being 0.45 (95\% CI: 0.29 to 0.70) and 0.44 (95\% CI: 0.24 to 0.78) in Hispanics and Chinese, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Ethnic associations with PAD remained significant even after adjustment for traditional and novel risk factors. This suggests that unknown factors may account for the residual ethnic differences in PAD.

  abstract = {Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is associated with mortality, amputation, and impaired quality of life. These Global Vascular Guidelines (GVG) are focused on definition, evaluation, and management of CLTI with the goals of improving evidence-based care and highlighting critical research needs. The term CLTI is preferred over critical limb ischemia, as the latter implies threshold values of impaired perfusion rather than a continuum. CLTI is a clinical syndrome defined by the presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in combination with rest pain, gangrene, or a lower limb ulceration {$>$}2 weeks duration. Venous, traumatic, embolic, and nonatherosclerotic etiologies are excluded. All patients with suspected CLTI should be referred urgently to a vascular specialist. Accurately staging the severity of limb threat is fundamental, and the Society for Vascular Surgery Threatened Limb Classification system, based on grading of Wounds, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) is endorsed. Objective hemodynamic testing, including toe pressures as the preferred measure, is required to assess CLTI. Evidence-based revascularization (EBR) hinges on three independent axes: Patient risk, Limb severity, and ANatomic complexity (PLAN). Average-risk and high-risk patients are defined by estimated procedural and 2-year all-cause mortality. The GVG proposes a new Global Anatomic Staging System (GLASS), which involves defining a preferred target artery path (TAP) and then estimating limb-based patency (LBP), resulting in three stages of complexity for intervention. The optimal revascularization strategy is also influenced by the availability of autogenous vein for open bypass surgery. Recommendations for EBR are based on best available data, pending level 1 evidence from ongoing trials. Vein bypass may be preferred for average-risk patients with advanced limb threat and high complexity disease, while those with less complex anatomy, intermediate severity limb threat, or high patient risk may be favored for endovascular intervention. All patients with CLTI should be afforded best medical therapy including the use of antithrombotic, lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and glycemic control agents, as well as counseling on smoking cessation, diet, exercise, and preventive foot care. Following EBR, long-term limb surveillance is advised. The effectiveness of nonrevascularization therapies (eg, spinal stimulation, pneumatic compression, prostanoids, and hyperbaric oxygen) has not been established.

In addition, we studied 10 patients with stable claudication (20 limbs) to determine the reproducibility of the three measures. RAI was the most reproducible measure, with the smallest variance between testing days (P less than 0.001). RAI differentiated between arteriographically diseased and normal limbs with a sensitivity of 97\% and a specificity of 100\%, whereas the corresponding values for TE were 97\% and 96\% and for PORH 89\% and 96\%. Recovery to baseline index was prolonged in the diseased group compared with normal (p less than 0.001 for both TE and PORH), but this was of limited discriminative value. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis documented that RAI was as diagnostically useful as TE and that both were more valuable than PORH (P less than 0.02). However, the routine addition of stress testing increased diagnostic yield by only 1.6\% and cost \$1100 for each limb correctly diagnosed through the addition of stress testing. RAI is a simple, accurate, and reproducible test. Routine stress testing is not cost effective, adding little diagnostic information to RAI, and it should be reserved for the small subset of symptomatic patients with normal RAI.},

  abstract = {Objective To determine the effects of antiplatelet therapy among patients at high risk of occlusive vascular events. Design Collaborative meta-analyses (systematic overviews). Inclusion criteria Randomised trials of an antiplatelet regimen versus control or of one antiplatelet regimen versus another in high risk patients (with acute or previous vascular disease or some other predisposing condition) from which results were available before September 1997. Trials had to use a method of randomisation that precluded prior knowledge of the next treatment to be allocated and comparisons had to be unconfounded\textemdash that is, have study groups that differed only in terms of antiplatelet regimen. Studies reviewed 287 studies involving 135\,000 patients in comparisons of antiplatelet therapy versus control and 77\,000 in comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens. Main outcome measure ``Serious vascular event'': non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death. Results Overall, among these high risk patients, allocation to antiplatelet therapy reduced the combined outcome of any serious vascular event by about one quarter; non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by one third, non-fatal stroke by one quarter, and vascular mortality by one sixth (with no apparent adverse effect on other deaths). Absolute reductions in the risk of having a serious vascular event were 36 (SE 5) per 1000 treated for two years among patients with previous myocardial infarction; 38 (5) per 1000 patients treated for one month among patients with acute myocardial infarction; 36 (6) per 1000 treated for two years among those with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack; 9 (3) per 1000 treated for three weeks among those with acute stroke; and 22 (3) per 1000 treated for two years among other high risk patients (with separately significant results for those with stable angina (P=0.0005), peripheral arterial disease (P=0.004), and atrial fibrillation (P=0.01)). In each of these high risk categories, the absolute benefits substantially outweighed the absolute risks of major extracranial bleeding. Aspirin was the most widely studied antiplatelet drug, with doses of 75-150 mg daily at least as effective as higher daily doses. The effects of doses lower than 75 mg daily were less certain. Clopidogrel reduced serious vascular events by 10\% (4\%) compared with aspirin, which was similar to the 12\% (7\%) reduction observed with its analogue ticlopidine. Addition of dipyridamole to aspirin produced no significant further reduction in vascular events compared with aspirin alone. Among patients at high risk of immediate coronary occlusion, short term addition of an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist to aspirin prevented a further 20 (4) vascular events per 1000 (P{$<$}0.0001) but caused 23 major (but rarely fatal) extracranial bleeds per 1000. Conclusions Aspirin (or another oral antiplatelet drug) is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those with an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischaemia, peripheral arterial disease, or atrial fibrillation. Low dose aspirin (75-150 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long term use, but in acute settings an initial loading dose of at least 150 mg aspirin may be required. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefits in some clinical circumstances, but more research into this strategy is needed.,  What is already known on this topicAntiplatelet therapy is effective for short term treatment of patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction and unstable anginaLong term treatment is beneficial for patients who have had a myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischaemic attackDaily aspirin doses of 75-325 mg are effectiveWhat this study addsAntiplatelet therapy protects against vascular events among patients with stable angina, intermittent claudication, and (if oral anticoagulants are unsuitable) atrial fibrillationAntiplatelet therapy can be started promptly during acute presumed ischaemic stroke and continued long termDaily aspirin doses of 75-150 mg seem to be as effective as higher doses for long term treatments (and clopidrogel is an appropriate alternative for patients with a contraindication to aspirin)Short term addition of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist to aspirin prevents vascular events in patients having percutaneous coronary intervention and those with unstable angina but causes increased bleeding},

  abstract = {Background: A systematic review and network meta-analysis was undertaken to consider the evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of placebo, cilostazol, naftidrofuryl oxalate and pentoxifylline in patients with intermittent claudication due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, Conference Proceedings, BIOSIS, National Research Register and MetaRegister databases were searched. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and published systematic reviews of patients with intermittent claudication due to PAD and whose symptoms persisted despite a period of conservative management. Study selection was conducted by one reviewer with involvement from a clinician. Data were extracted by one reviewer with no blinding to authors or journal, and checked by a second reviewer. Outcome measures were maximum walking distance (MWD) and pain-free walking distance (PFWD). Results: The review identified 1876 citations; 26 RCTs met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Eleven trials provided data relevant for the meta-analysis. Naftidrofuryl oxalate was ranked first for both MWD and PFWD (probability of 0{$\cdot$}947 and 0{$\cdot$}987, respectively, of being the best treatment) followed by cilostazol and pentoxifylline. For naftidrofuryl oxalate, cilostazol and pentoxifylline, MWD increased by 60 (95 per cent credible interval 20 to 114) per cent, 25 (11 to 40) per cent and 11 (-1 to 24) per cent respectively relative to placebo, and PFWD increased by 49, 13 and 9 per cent. Conclusion: Naftidrofuryl oxalate and cilostazol are both effective treatments for claudication; naftidrofuryl oxalate is likely to be the most effective, with minimal serious adverse events.

It is caused by inadequate blood flow to the leg muscles caused by atherosclerosis (fatty deposits restricting blood flow through the arteries). People with mild to moderate claudication are advised to keep walking, stop smoking, and reduce cardiovascular risk factors. Other treatments include antiplatelet therapy, pentoxifylline or cilostazol, angioplasty (inserting a balloon into the artery to open it up), and bypass surgery.,            Studies and key results         , Review authors identified 32 controlled trials that randomised 1835 adults with stable leg pain to exercise, usual care or placebo, or other interventions (current until November 2016). Researchers measured outcomes at times ranging from two weeks to two years. Types of exercise varied from strength training to polestriding and upper or lower limb exercises; in general, supervised sessions were held at least twice a week. The quality of included trials was moderate, mainly because of absence of relevant information. Ten trials reported that in the exercise groups, pain-free walking distance and the maximum distance that participants could walk was increased. Improvements were seen for up to two years. Exercise did not improve ankle to brachial blood pressure index. No evidence of an effect of exercise was seen on death or need for amputation because data were limited. Researchers assessed quality of life using the SF-36 Questionnaire at three and six months. At three months, indicators of quality of life - 'physical function', 'vitality', and 'role physical' - had all improved with exercise, but these data are limited, as only two trials reported this. Five studies reported improved 'physical summary score' and four studies reported improved 'mental health score' following exercise at six months, with two trials also reporting improvements in 'physical function' and 'general health'. All other domains showed no improvement at six months following exercise., Comparisons of exercise with antiplatelet therapy, pentoxifylline, iloprost, vitamin E, and pneumatic foot and calf compression were limited because numbers of identified trials and participants were small.,            Quality of the evidence         , The present review shows that exercise programmes appear to improve walking distance for people considered fit for exercise regimens. This benefit appears to be sustained over two years. Evidence presented in this review was of moderate to high quality. Although differences between trials were evident, populations and outcomes were comparable overall, and findings were relevant to people with intermittent claudication. Combined results were derived from large sample sizes - over 300 participants for most outcomes - using reproducible methods.},

  abstract = {Supervised exercise therapy vs home-based exercise therapy vs walking advice for patients with leg pain while walking (intermittent claudication)         ,            Background         , Intermittent claudication is a cramping leg pain that occurs during walking and is relieved by a short period of rest. It is caused by inadequate blood flow to the muscles of the leg due to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Exercise therapy provides significant symptomatic benefit for patients with intermittent claudication. Patients are recommended to walk at least three times a week by themselves. However, they can also participate in a formal supervised exercise program that involves walking on a treadmill or complete a structured home-based exercise program with an observation component (e.g., exercise logbooks, pedometers).,            Study characteristics and key results         , We included 21 trials in which a total of 1400 participants with intermittent claudication (65\% male, mean age 66 years) had been assigned to supervised exercise therapy, home-based exercise therapy, or walking advice (search last run December 2016). The overall methodological quality of included trials was moderate to good. However, some trials had enrolled only small numbers of participants. Trials lasted from six weeks to two years., This review shows that patients participating in a supervised exercise program improve their walking ability to a greater extent than those completing a home-based exercise program or just following walking advice. After three months, the maximal walking distance for participants following the supervised exercise program was 120 or 210 meters farther than the maximal walking distance for those who followed a home-based exercise program or received walking advice, respectively. To put these increases in context, a US football field is roughly 90 meters (or 100 yards) long. Before participating in the exercise program, the maximal walking distance of participants was 290 meters with a pain-free walking distance of 140 meters, so this improvement is likely to have a positive impact on their lives. Results of the home-based exercise program were similar to those reported for walking advice., Compared with home-based exercise therapy, supervised exercise therapy was more beneficial for pain-free walking distance but had no effect on quality of life measures nor on self-reported functional impairment. Compared with walking advice, supervised exercise therapy was more beneficial for pain-free walking distance and self-reported functional impairment, as well as for some quality of life measures (e.g., physical functioning, pain, and physical component summary after 12 months), and home-based exercise therapy had no effect., Data show no obvious effects on mortality rates. Thirteen of the 1400 participants died, but no deaths were related to exercise therapy. Overall, adherence to supervised exercise therapy was approximately 80\%, which was similar to that reported with home-based exercise therapy. Only limited adherence data were available for walking advice groups.,            Quality of the evidence         , Evidence of moderate and high quality shows that supervised exercise therapy improves walking distance (maximal and pain-free) to a greater extent than home-based exercise therapy and walking advice, respectively. Trials show no clear differences in quality of life measures nor in self-reported functional impairment between supervised exercise therapy and home-based exercise therapy. However, evidence is of low and very low quality, respectively. Investigators detected some improvements in quality of life favoring supervised exercise therapy over walking advice, but analyses were limited by small numbers of studies and participants. More research is needed on disease-specific quality of life and other functional outcomes, such as walking behavior and physical activity, as well as on long-term follow-up., Adhering to an exercise program is important because it leads to decreased leg pain and improved quality of life, as well as to likely improvement in general physical condition.},

In addition, the effects on peripheral vascular events (ie, non-coronary revascularization, aneurysm repairs, major amputations or PAD deaths) can be assessed. Methods: 6748 UK adults with PAD and 13,788 other high-risk participants were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily or matching placebo, yielding an average LDL cholesterol difference of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during a mean of 5 years. Results: For participants with PAD, allocation to simvastatin was associated with a highly significant 22\% (95\% CI 15-29) relative reduction in the rate of first major vascular event following randomisation (895 [26.4\%] simvastatin-allocated vs 1101 [32.7\%] placebo-allocated; P {$<$} .0001), which was similar to that seen among the other high-risk participants. The absolute reduction in first major vascular event was 63 (SE 11) per 1000 patients with PAD and 50 (SE 7) per 1000 without pre-existing PAD. Overall, among all participants, there was a 16\% (5-25) relative reduction in the rate of first peripheral vascular event following randomisation (479 [4.7\%] simvastatin vs 561 [5.5\%] placebo), largely irrespective of baseline LDL cholesterol and other factors. This effect chiefly reflects a 20\% (8-31) relative reduction in non-coronary revascularization procedures (334 [3.3\%] vs 415 [4.0\%]; P ؍ .002). Conclusion: HPS demonstrates the benefits of cholesterol-lowering statin therapy in patients with PAD, regardless of their presenting cholesterol levels and other presenting features. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduces the rate of first major vascular events by about one-quarter, and that of peripheral vascular events by about one-sixth, with large absolute benefits seen in participants with PAD because of their high vascular risk. Consequently, statin therapy should be considered routinely for all patients with PAD. ( J Vasc Surg 2007;45:645-54.)},

  abstract = {Background: The treatment of rest pain, ulceration, and gangrene of the leg (severe limb ischaemia) remains controversial. We instigated the BASIL trial to compare the outcome of bypass surgery and balloon angioplasty in such patients. Methods: We randomly assigned 452 patients, who presented to 27 UK hospitals with severe limb ischaemia due to infra-inguinal disease, to receive a surgery-first (n=228) or an angioplasty-first (n=224) strategy. The primary endpoint was amputation (of trial leg) free survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. The BASIL trial is registered with the National Research Register (NRR) and as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN45398889. Findings: The trial ran for 5{$\cdot$}5 years, and follow-up finished when patients reached an endpoint (amputation of trial leg above the ankle or death). Seven individuals were lost to follow-up after randomisation (three assigned angioplasty, two surgery); of these, three were lost (one angioplasty, two surgery) during the first year of follow-up. 195 (86\%) of 228 patients assigned to bypass surgery and 216 (96\%) of 224 to balloon angioplasty underwent an attempt at their allocated intervention at a median (IQR) of 6 (3-16) and 6 (2-20) days after randomisation, respectively. At the end of follow-up, 248 (55\%) patients were alive without amputation (of trial leg), 38 (8\%) alive with amputation, 36 (8\%) dead after amputation, and 130 (29\%) dead without amputation. After 6 months, the two strategies did not differ significantly in amputation-free survival (48 vs 60 patients; unadjusted hazard ratio 1{$\cdot$}07, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}72-1{$\cdot$}6; adjusted hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}73, 0{$\cdot$}49-1{$\cdot$}07). We saw no difference in health-related quality of life between the two strategies, but for the first year the hospital costs associated with a surgery-first strategy were about one third higher than those with an angioplasty-first strategy. Interpretation: In patients presenting with severe limb ischaemia due to infra-inguinal disease and who are suitable for surgery and angioplasty, a bypass-surgery-first and a balloon-angioplasty- first strategy are associated with broadly similar outcomes in terms of amputation-free survival, and in the short-term, surgery is more expensive than angioplasty.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy as part of a treatment strategy for patients requiring revascularization for lower limb ischemia caused by nonembolic arterial and graft occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with native arterial or bypass graft occlusion were randomized prospectively to either optimal surgical procedure or intra-arterial, catheter-directed thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or urokinase (UK). Thrombolysis patients required successful catheter placement into the occlusion before infusion of either rt-PA at 0.05 mg/kg/hr for up to 12 hours or UK of 250,000 units bolus followed by 4000 units/min x 4 hours, then 2000 units/min for up to 36 hours. A composite clinical outcome of death, ongoing/recurrent ischemia, major amputation, and major morbidity was the primary endpoint. Additional endpoints were reduction in surgical procedure, clinical outcome classification, length of hospitalization, and outcome by duration of ischemia. RESULTS: Randomization was terminated at 393 patients because a significant primary endpoint occurred by the first interim analysis. Failure of catheter placement occurred in 28\% of patients who were randomized to lysis, and thus, were considered treatment failures. Thirty-day outcomes demonstrated significant benefit to surgical therapy compared with thrombolysis (p {$<$} 0.001), primarily because of a reduction in ongoing/recurrent ischemia (p {$<$} 0.001). However, clinical outcome classification at 30 days was similar. Stratification by duration of ischemia indicated that patients with ischemic deterioration of 0 to 14 days had lower amputation rates with thrombolysis (p = 0.052) and shorter hospital stays (p {$<$} 0.04). Patients with ischemic deterioration of {$>$} 14 days who who were treated surgically had less ongoing/recurrent ischemia (p {$<$} 0.001) and trends toward lower morbidity (p = 0.1). At 6-month follow-up, there was improved amputation-free survival in acutely ischemic patients treated with thrombolysis (p = 0.01); however, chronically ischemic patients who were treated surgically had significantly lower major amputations rates (p = 0.01). More than half of thrombolysis patients (55.8\%) had a reduction in magnitude of their surgical procedure (p {$<$} 0.001). There was no difference in efficacy or safety between rt-PA and UK; however, in the thrombolysis group as a whole, fibrinogen depletion predicted hemorrhagic complications (p {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical revascularization of patients with {$<$} 6 months of ischemia is more effective and safer than catheter-directed thrombolysis. Although ongoing/recurrent ischemia is greater in the patients undergoing thrombolysis, 30-day clinical outcomes are similar, probably because of cross-over treatment to surgery. There is no difference in efficacy or safety between rt-PA and UK, although bleeding occurs in patients with greater fibrinogen depletion. A significant reduction in planned surgical procedure is observed after thrombolysis. Patients with acute ischemia (0-14 days) who were treated with thrombolysis had improved amputation-free survival and shorter hospital stays. However, for patients with chronic ischemia ({$>$} 14 days), surgical revascularization was more effective and safer than thrombolysis. Combining a treatment strategy of catheter-directed thrombolysis for acute limb ischemia with surgical revascularization for chronic limb ischemia offers the best overall results.},

  abstract = {Surgery versus thrombolysis for the initial management of acute limb ischaemia         ,            Background         , Thrombolysis involves dissolving a blood clot by injecting a chemical agent at the site of the clot. It can be used as an alternative to surgery for managing sudden severely reduced blood flow (acute ischaemia) in the leg. A blood clot (thrombosis) can form in a leg blood vessel that shows severe narrowing (stenosis) in a natural artery or a bypass graft, or it can travel into the leg arteries after forming elsewhere, when it is called an embolus. Major complications of thrombolysis are bleeding and stroke.,            Study characteristics and key results         , Authors of the review identified five controlled trials with a total of 1292 participants who needed immediate care for reduced blood flow in the leg(s) (current until 7 May 2018). Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups for initial treatment: (1) non-surgical thrombolysis, or (2) surgery. The specific agents used to break up clots (thrombolytic agents) were called recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase. The included studies provided no clear evidence about which treatment - thrombolysis or surgery - was a better option for preventing limb amputation (limb salvage) and no clear evidence about which treatment was better for preventing death or improving amputation rates within one month, six months, or one year after initial treatment. Evidence for these three outcomes at one month was rated between low and very low quality. No conclusion can be made about which treatment was better for keeping vessels unblocked after treatment (vessel patency) because this outcome was not well reported. More major complications, including bleeding (haemorrhage) and continued ischaemia or blockage (distal embolisation), were reported in the group receiving thrombolysis. There was no difference in the occurrence of stroke at one month between the two treatment groups. Although people receiving initial thrombolysis had increased risk of some complications, they showed greater reduction in the level of intervention required compared with that predicted before intervention. The higher risks of complications with thrombolysis have to be weighted against individual risks in surgery.,            Quality of the evidence         , The quality of the evidence was generally low. We downgraded the quality owing to risk of bias. Bias is a way to describe how researchers, clinicians, or participants might influence results unintentionally. Blinding is a method used to prevent people involved in the trial from knowing what treatment group a participant was in and reducing measurement bias. None of the studies included in this review used methods to stop participants or researchers or outcome assessors from knowing what treatment they were assigned to. Also, there was uncertainty about the true effect of each treatment type. Results show wide differences in outcome measures (effects) between studies (heterogeneity). For example, following surgical treatment, one-year mortality ranged from 9.8\% to 42\%. Such a wide range in percentages may indicate that the studies compared were quite different. In addition, both selection criteria (duration of treatment and severity of ischaemia) and method of thrombolysis (agent, dose, and duration) varied between studies, making comparison more difficult.,            Conclusion         , This review found no evidence of a difference between thrombolysis and surgery for treatment of acute limb ischaemia for our outcomes of interest. Those receiving thrombolysis treatment may be at higher risk of complications such as bleeding. The quality of data generated by the included studies is low.},

  abstract = {Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a rapid decrease in lower limb blood flow due to acute occlusion of peripheral artery or bypass graft, and in ALI not only limbs but also life prognosis will be poor unless quick and appropriate treatment is given. The etiology is broadly divided into embolism and thrombosis with various comorbidities. The symptoms of ALI are abrupt with pain, numbness, and coldness of lower limb, and paresthesia, contracture, and irreversible purpura will appear with the exacerbation of ischemia. Severity and treatment strategy should be determined based on physical findings and image findings. Considering life prognosis, limb amputation should be done without hesitation when the limb was diagnosed as irreversible. ALI can be treated by means of open surgical revascularization, endovascular, or hybrid approach with rapid systemic administration of heparin. In any cases, evaluating the lesions by intraoperative angiography and appropriate additional treatment are important. ALI is a serious disease requiring urgent treatment, and it is essential to promptly perform the best initial treatment that can be performed at each facility.

We now report the results of a blinded, prospective study in a larger patient group designed to determine the ability of mesenterie duplex scanning to visualize the CA and SMA and to validate our proposed duplex criteria for splanchnic artery stenosis. Methods: During an 18-month period 100 patients admitted to our vascular surgery service for aortography underwent routine mesenteric artery duplex scanning and lateral abdominal aortography regardless of abdominal symptoms. The lateral aortograms were evaluated to determine the presence or absence of a 70\% or greater stenosis in the CA or SMA. Duplex-determined peak systolic velocities from the CA and SMA were recorded without knowledge of the angiographic results. Results: Aortography satisfactorilyvisualized 100\% of the CAs and 99\% of the SMAs. Of these, 93\% of the SMAs and 83\% of the CAs were visualized by duplex. According to the above criteria, duplex sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracyfor detection of a 70\% or greater SMA stenosis were 92\%, 96\%, 80\%, 99\%, and 96\% and for a 70\% or greater CA stenosis 87\%, 80\%, 63\%, 94\%, and 82\%. Conclusions: Mesenteric duplex scanning is feasible in the majority of patients. Prospective evaluation of duplex diagnostic criteria for 70\% or greater stenosis indicates that mesenteric duplex scanning is sufficiently accurate to be clinically useful as a screening examination to detect SMA and CA stenosis.

  abstract = {Purpose: To validate the accuracy of previously established duplex ultrasound criteria for \textasciitilde 50\% superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and celiac artery (CA) stenosis by comparison with arteriography. Methods: Duplex criteria established retrospectively in our laboratory in 1991 identified an end-diastolic velocity (EDV) \textasciitilde 45 cm/sec, or no flow signal, as highly sensitive (100\%) and specific (92\%) indicators for SMA stenosis \textasciitilde 50\% or occlusion. EDV was more accurate (95\%) than peak systolic velocity (PSV), which had a maximal accuracy of 86\% at a PSV \textasciitilde 300 em/sec, with low sensitivity (62\%), but high specificity (100\%). For CA, accurate velocity thresholds were not identified, but we subsequently noted that retrograde common hepatic artery flow direction from SMA collateral was highly predictive of severe CA stenosis or occlusion. Since publication of those findings, 243 mesenteric duplex scans were performed for clinical evaluation of suspected chronic mesenteric ischemia. Angiographic conf"rrmation was available for a subset of 46. SMA and CA diameters were measured on lateral aortograms by observers blinded to the duplex results, and the original duplex diagnostic criteria were tested for accuracy. In addition, receiver operator characteristic curve analysis was performed on the velocity data to identify the most accurate velocity thresholds in the new data. Results: Duplex was technically adequate in 98\% of SMA, 96\% of CA, and 89\% of hepatic arteries, and arteriograms were adequate in 100\% of SMA and 98\% of CA. For the SMA, EDV \textasciitilde 45 em/sec again provided the best sensitivity (90\%), specificity (91\%), positive predictive value (90\%), negative predictive value (91\%), and overall accuracy (91\%). As in the retrospective study, PSV \textasciitilde 300 em/sec provided low overall accuracy (81\%), low sensitivity (60\%), but high specificity (100\%). Lowering the PSV threshold improved sensitivity but reduced accuracy. For CA, retrograde common hepatic artery flow direction was 100\% predictive of severe CA stenosis or occlusion. Velocity data in CA provided accuracy not found in the original study. EDV \textasciitilde 55 em/sec or no flow signal had best overall accuracy (95\%) with high sensitivity (93\%) and specificity (100\%). PSV \textasciitilde 200 em/sec or no signal also had excellent accuracy (93\%), sensitivity (93\%), and specificity (94\%). In addition, three offour anatomic anomalies were correctly identified by duplex. These included one right hepatic and one common hepatic artery originating from the SMA, and one common celiacomesenteric trunk. Conclusion: This validation analysis confirms that duplex velocity criteria are accurate in the identification of mesenteric occlusive disease. Retrograde common hepatic artery flow direction correctly predicts severe CA stenosis or occlusion. Duplex ultrasound may also identify mesenteric anatomic variants that can influence study interpretation. (J Vasc Surg 1998;27:1078-88.)},

Despite two randomized trials that did not show a benefit of renal-artery stenting with respect to kidney function, the usefulness of stenting for the prevention of major adverse renal and cardiovascular events is uncertain. METHODS We randomly assigned 947 participants who had atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis and either systolic hypertension while taking two or more antihypertensive drugs or chronic kidney disease to medical therapy plus renal-artery stenting or medical therapy alone. Participants were followed for the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular and renal events (a composite end point of death from cardiovascular or renal causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, progressive renal insufficiency, or the need for renal-replacement therapy). RESULTS Over a median follow-up period of 43 months (interquartile range, 31 to 55), the rate of the primary composite end point did not differ significantly between participants who underwent stenting in addition to receiving medical therapy and those who received medical therapy alone (35.1\% and 35.8\%, respectively; hazard ratio with stenting, 0.94; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.17; P\,=\,0.58). There were also no significant differences between the treatment groups in the rates of the individual components of the primary end point or in all-cause mortality. During follow-up, there was a consistent modest difference in systolic blood pressure favoring the stent group (-2.3 mm Hg; 95\% CI, -4.4 to -0.2; P\,=\, \,0\, .03).

  abstract = {Background Percutaneous revascularization of the renal arteries improves patency in atherosclerotic renovascular disease, yet evidence of a clinical benefit is limited. Methods In a randomized, unblinded trial, we assigned 806 patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease either to undergo revascularization in addition to receiving medical therapy or to receive medical therapy alone. The primary outcome was renal function, as measured by the reciprocal of the serum creatinine level (a measure that has a linear relationship with creatinine clearance). Secondary outcomes were blood pressure, the time to renal and major cardiovascular events, and mortality. The median follow-up was 34 months. Results During a 5-year period, the rate of progression of renal impairment (as shown by the slope of the reciprocal of the serum creatinine level) was -0.07\texttimes 10-3 liters per micromole per year in the revascularization group, as compared with -0.13\texttimes 10-3 liters per micromole per year in the medical-therapy group, a difference favoring revascularization of 0.06\texttimes 10-3 liters per micromole per year (95\% confidence interval [CI], -0.002 to 0.13; P\,=\,0.06). Over the same time, the mean serum creatinine level was 1.6 {$\mu$}mol per liter (95\% CI, -8.4 to 5.2 [0.02 mg per deciliter; 95\% CI, -0.10 to 0.06]) lower in the revascularization group than in the medical-therapy group. There was no significant between-group difference in systolic blood pressure; the decrease in diastolic blood pressure was smaller in the revascularization group than in the medical-therapy group. The two study groups had similar rates of renal events (hazard ratio in the revascularization group, 0.97; 95\% CI, 0.67 to 1.40; P\,=\,0.88), major cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.75 to 1.19; P\,=\,0.61), and death (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95\% CI, 0.69 to 1.18; P\,=\,0.46).

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a composite device design (covered stent graft and bare metal stent) for the treatment of patients with acute, complicated type B aortic dissection (TBAD) presenting with aortic rupture and/or branch vessel malperfusion. Methods: In this prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter study, 73 patients (65.8\% male; mean age, 60.7 years) with acute, complicated TBAD were enrolled between August 2012 and January 2015 to receive treatment with the Zenith Dissection Endovascular System (William Cook Europe, Aps, Bjaeverskov, Denmark) at institutions in the United States and Japan. The primary safety end point was the rate of freedom from major adverse events at 30 days, and the primary effectiveness end point was the rate of survival at 30 days. This article reports primary outcomes at 30 days and follow-up results through 1 year, reflecting study data as of March 2018. Results: Of 73 patients, 20 presented with aortic rupture (27\%) and 57 presented with branch vessel obstruction/compromise (78\%), including 4 patients presenting with both conditions. The covered stent graft was used in all patients (median, 1; range, 1-3; 1 stent graft used in 64.4\%; 47/73), and the bare metal dissection stent was used in 58 of 73 patients (79.5\%). Thirty-day mortality occurred in five patients (6.8\%): one procedure related, three unrelated to dissection repair, and one indeterminate. Thirty-day major adverse events included myocardial infarction (1.4\%), bowel ischemia (1.4\%), renal insufficiency/renal failure requiring dialysis (6.8\%), stroke (6.8\%), paraplegia or paraparesis (5.5\%), and prolonged ventilatory support (13.7\%). Nine deaths occurred from 31 to 365 days (only one death related to dissection repair); the Kaplan-Meier estimate of freedom from all-cause mortality was 80.3\% {$\pm$} 4.7\% at 1 year. Within 365 days, 9 of 73 patients (12.3\%) underwent 10 secondary interventions; no patients required conversion to open surgery. At the 12-month follow-up, complete or partial thrombosis of the false lumen was seen in 100\% of patients (46/46) within the stent graft region and in 97.4\% of patients (38/39) within the dissection stent region. Growth ({$>$}5 mm) of the maximum transaortic diameter was observed in 14.9\% of patients (7/47) in the stent graft region and in 38.5\% of patients (15/39) within the dissection stent region at 12 months. Conclusions: Thirty-day and 1-year results from the STABLE II study demonstrated favorable clinical and anatomical outcomes for the treatment of rupture and malperfusion in the setting of acute, complicated TBAD. Five-year follow-up is ongoing.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy and endovenous laser ablation are widely used alternatives to surgery for the treatment of varicose veins, but their comparative effectiveness and safety remain uncertain. METHODS In a randomized trial involving 798 participants with primary varicose veins at 11 centers in the United Kingdom, we compared the outcomes of foam, laser, and surgical treatments. Primary outcomes at 6 months were disease-specific quality of life and generic quality of life, as measured on several scales. Secondary outcomes included complications and measures of clinical success. RESULTS After adjustment for baseline scores and other covariates, the mean disease-specific quality of life was slightly worse after treatment with foam than after surgery (P\,=\,0.006) but was similar in the laser and surgery groups. There were no significant differences between the surgery group and the foam or the laser group in measures of generic quality of life. The frequency of procedural complications was similar in the foam group (6\%) and the surgery group (7\%) but was lower in the laser group (1\%) than in the surgery group (P{$<$}0.001); the frequency of serious adverse events (approximately 3\%) was similar among the groups. Measures of clinical success were similar among the groups, but successful ablation of the main trunks of the saphenous vein was less common in the foam group than in the surgery group (P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS Quality-of-life measures were generally similar among the study groups, with the exception of a slightly worse disease-specific quality of life in the foam group than in the surgery group. All treatments had similar clinical efficacy, but complications were less frequent after laser treatment and ablation rates were lower after foam treatment.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Venous disease is the most common cause of leg ulceration. Although compression therapy improves venous ulcer healing, it does not treat the underlying causes of venous hypertension. Treatment of superficial venous reflux has been shown to reduce the rate of ulcer recurrence, but the effect of early endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux on ulcer healing remains unclear. METHODS In a trial conducted at 20 centers in the United Kingdom, we randomly assigned 450 patients with venous leg ulcers to receive compression therapy and undergo early endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux within 2 weeks after randomization (earlyintervention group) or to receive compression therapy alone, with consideration of endovenous ablation deferred until after the ulcer was healed or until 6 months after randomization if the ulcer was unhealed (deferred-intervention group). The primary outcome was the time to ulcer healing. Secondary outcomes were the rate of ulcer healing at 24 weeks, the rate of ulcer recurrence, the length of time free from ulcers (ulcer-free time) during the first year after randomization, and patient-reported healthrelated quality of life. RESULTS Patient and clinical characteristics at baseline were similar in the two treatment groups. The time to ulcer healing was shorter in the early-intervention group than in the deferred-intervention group; more patients had healed ulcers with early intervention (hazard ratio for ulcer healing, 1.38; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.13 to 1.68; P\,=\,0.001). The median time to ulcer healing was 56 days (95\% CI, 49 to 66) in the early-intervention group and 82 days (95\% CI, 69 to 92) in the deferred-intervention group. The rate of ulcer healing at 24 weeks was 85.6\% in the early-intervention group and 76.3\% in the deferred-intervention group. The median ulcer-free time during the first year after trial enrollment was 306 days (interquartile range, 240 to 328) in the early-intervention group and 278 days (interquartile range, 175 to 324) in the deferredintervention group (P\,=\,0.002). The most common procedural complications of endovenous ablation were pain and deep-vein thrombosis.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The post-thrombotic syndrome frequently develops in patients with proximal deep-vein thrombosis despite treatment with anticoagulant therapy. Pharmacomechanical catheterdirected thrombolysis (hereafter ``pharmacomechanical thrombolysis'') rapidly removes thrombus and is hypothesized to reduce the risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome. METHODS We randomly assigned 692 patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis to receive either anticoagulation alone (control group) or anticoagulation plus pharmaco\- mechanical thrombolysis (catheter-mediated or device-mediated intrathrombus delivery of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and thrombus aspiration or maceration, with or without stenting). The primary outcome was development of the post-thrombotic syndrome between 6 and 24 months of follow-up. RESULTS Between 6 and 24 months, there was no significant between-group difference in the percentage of patients with the post-thrombotic syndrome (47\% in the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group and 48\% in the control group; risk ratio, 0.96; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.11; P\,=\,0.56). Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis led to more major bleeding events within 10 days (1.7\% vs. 0.3\% of patients, P\,=\,0.049), but no significant difference in recurrent venous thromboembolism was seen over the 24-month follow-up period (12\% in the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group and 8\% in the control group, P\,=\,0.09). Moderate-to-severe post-thrombotic syndrome occurred in 18\% of patients in the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group versus 24\% of those in the control group (risk ratio, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.54 to 0.98; P\,=\,0.04). Severity scores for the post-thrombotic syndrome were lower in the pharmacomechanicalthrombolysis group than in the control group at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of follow-up (P{$<$}0.01 for the comparison of the Villalta scores at each time point), but the improvement in quality of life from baseline to 24 months did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis, the addition of pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis to anticoagulation did not result in a lower risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome but did result in a higher risk of major bleeding.

  abstract = {Background: This study compares the accuracy of cerebral monitoring systems in detecting cerebral ischemia during carotid endarterectomy. Methods: The authors compared transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), stump pressure (SP) measurement, and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) in 48 patients undergoing carotid surgery during regional anesthesia. Cerebral ischemia was assumed when neurologic deterioration occurred. During clamping, the minimum mean middle cerebral artery velocity (TCDmin), its percentage change (TCD\%), the minimum regional saturation of oxygen (NIRSmin), its percentage change (NIRS\%), the mean SP, and the changes of SEP amplitude were recorded. To analyze the corresponding sensitivity and specificity of each parameter, the authors performed receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results: Neurologic deterioration occurred in 12 patients. SP and NIRS were successfully performed in all patients. TCD monitoring was not possible in 10 (21\%); SEP was not possible in 2 patients (4\%). All parameters provided the ability to distinguish between ischemic and nonischemic patients. TCD\% and NIRS\% showed significantly better discrimination than TCDmin and NIRSmin (P {$<$} 0.05). The highest area under the curve (AUC) was found for TCD\% (AUC ؍ 0.973), but there was no significant difference compared with NIRS\% (AUC ؍ 0.905) and SP (AUC ؍ 0.925). The lowest AUC was found for SEP (AUC ؍ 0.749), which was significantly lower than that for TCD\%, NIRS\%, and SP. Conclusions: TCD\%, NIRS\%, and SP measurement provide similar accuracy for the detection of cerebral ischemia during carotid surgery. Lower accuracy was found for SEP monitoring. Because of the high rate of technical difficulties (21\%), TCD monitoring was the least practical of the investigated monitoring devices.},

  abstract = {Objective: This study reports the results of a prospective, multicenter trial designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Zenith fenestrated endovascular graft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) for treatment of juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Methods: Sixty-seven patients with juxtarenal AAAs were prospectively enrolled in 14 centers in the United States from 2005 to 2012. Custom-made fenestrated stent grafts were designed with one to three fenestrations on the basis of analysis of computed tomography data sets. Renal alignment was performed with balloon-expandable stents. Follow-up included clinical examination, laboratory studies, mesenteric-renal duplex ultrasound, abdominal radiography, and computed tomography imaging at hospital discharge and at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months and yearly thereafter up to 5 years. Results: There were 54 male and 13 female patients with a mean age of 74 6 8 years enrolled. Mean aneurysm diameter was 60 6 10 mm. A total of 178 visceral arteries required incorporation with small fenestrations in 118, scallops in 51, and large fenestrations in nine. Of these, all 118 small fenestrations (100\%), eight of the scallops (16\%), and one of the large fenestrations (11\%) were aligned by stents. Technical success was 100\%. There was one postoperative death within 30 days (1.5\%). Mean length of hospital stay was 3.3 6 2.1 days. No aneurysm ruptures or conversions were noted during a mean follow-up of 37 6 17 months (range, 3-65 months). Two patients (3\%) had migration \$10 mm with no endoleak, both due to cranial progression of aortic disease. Of a total of 129 renal arteries targeted by a fenestration, there were four (3\%) renal artery occlusions and 12 (9\%) stenoses. Fifteen patients (22\%) required secondary interventions for renal artery stenosis/occlusion in 11 patients, type II endoleak in three patients, and type I endoleak in one patient. At 5 years, patient survival was 91\% 6 4\%, and freedom from major adverse events was 79\% 6 6\%; primary and secondary patency of targeted renal arteries was 81\% 6 5\% and 97\% 6 2\%, freedom from renal function deterioration was 91\% 6 5\%, and freedom from secondary interventions was 63\% 6 9\%. Conclusions: This prospective study demonstrates that endovascular repair of juxtarenal AAAs with the Zenith fenestrated AAA stent graft is safe and effective. Mortality and morbidity are low in properly selected patients treated in centers with experience in these procedures. (J Vasc Surg 2014;60:1420-8.)},

  abstract = {Background: In this study, we systematically reviewed late open conversions after failed endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), assessed the methodologic quality of the included studies, and performed a meta-analysis on the 30-day mortality rates for urgent and elective late conversions. Methods: Electronic databases were systematically searched for studies published up to June 2018 that focused on late open conversion of failed EVAR (ie, {$>$}30 days after the initial EVAR), reported the primary outcome of 30-day mortality rate, and distinguished the 30-day mortality rate between urgent and elective late conversions. Two independent reviewers assessed the methodologic quality of the included studies with the Methodological Index for NonRandomized Studies. Data on baseline demographics, indication for conversion, surgical approach, and early and late mortality rates were recorded. Reported data correspond to the average or range of the means reported in the individual studies. A random-effects model was used to pool 30-day mortality rates for urgent and elective late conversion. Results: There were 27 retrospective studies with a total of 791 patients available for analysis, with 617 elective and 174 urgent late conversions. The methodologic quality was mostly poor (median, 6; interquartile range, 5-7). The mean time from primary EVAR to conversion was 35.1 months (95\% confidence interval [CI], 30.4-39.8 months). The most commonly explanted endografts were Excluder (W. L. Gore \& Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) in 16.2\%, Talent (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn) in 14.5\%, and AneuRx (Medtronic) in 13.7\%. Nineteen other types of endografts were used in 43.3\%; the type of endograft was not reported in 12.3\%. A transperitoneal approach was used in a mean 74.0\% of conversions (95\% CI, 70.9\%-77.0\%), and complete endograft explantation was performed in 478 (60.4\%) patients (95\% CI, 57.0\%-63.8\%). The complication rate was 36.7\% (95\% CI, 27.0\%-46.4\%). Temporary or permanent hemodialysis after conversion was required in 3.9\% of patients (95\% CI, 2.6\%-5.2\%). The pooled estimate for the 30-day mortality rate was 2.8\% (95\% CI, 1.5\%-4.0\%; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .726) for elective late conversions and 28.1\% (95\% CI, 18.9\%-37.3\%; P {$<$} .001) for urgent late conversions. Conclusions: Type I endoleak and rupture are the most common indications for, respectively, elective and urgent conversions. A 10 times higher 30-day mortality rate was observed for patients treated with late open conversion in an urgent vs elective setting. The 30-day mortality rate of elective late open conversions is almost comparable to that of primary elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair procedures. For the interpretation of the outcomes of the review, however, the methodologic quality of the available literature should be considered. (J Vasc Surg 2019;70:615-28.)},

  abstract = {Background: Evidence for benefit of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) over open surgical repair for de novo infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in younger patients remains conflicting because of heterogeneous study populations and small sample sizes. The objective of this study was to compare perioperative and short-term outcomes for EVAR and open surgery in younger patients using a large national disease and procedure-specific data set. Methods: We identified patients 65 years of age or younger undergoing first-time elective EVAR or open AAA repair from the Vascular Quality Initiative (2003-2014). We excluded patients with pararenal or thoracoabdominal aneurysms, those medically unfit for open repair, and those undergoing EVAR for isolated iliac aneurysms. Clinical and procedural characteristics were balanced using inverse propensity of treatment weighting. A supplemental analysis extended the study to those younger than 70 years. Results: We identified 2641 patients, 73\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1928) EVAR and 27\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 713) open repair. The median age was 62 years (interquartile range, 59-64 years), and 13\% were female. The median follow-up time was 401 days (interquartile range, 357459 days). Unadjusted perioperative survival was 99.6\% overall (open repair, 99.1\%; EVAR, 99.8\%; P {$<$} .001), with 97.4\% 1-year survival overall (open repair, 97.3\%; EVAR, 97.4\%; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .9). Unadjusted reintervention rates were five (open repair) and seven (EVAR) reinterventions per 100 person-years (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .8). After propensity weighting, the absolute incidence of perioperative mortality was {$<$}1\% in both groups (open repair, 0.9\%, EVAR, 0.2\%; P {$<$} .001), and complication rates were low. Propensity-weighted survival (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95\% confidence interval, 0.56-1.38; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .6) and reintervention rates (open repair, 6; EVAR, 8; reinterventions per 100 person-years; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .8) did not differ between the two interventions. The analysis of those younger than 70 years showed similar results. Conclusions: In this study of younger patients undergoing repair of infrarenal AAA, 30-day morbidity and mortality for both open surgery and EVAR are low, and the absolute mortality difference is small. The prior published perioperative mortality and 1-year survival benefit of EVAR over open AAA repair is not observed in younger patients. Further studies of long-term durability are needed to guide decision-making for open repair vs EVAR in this population. (J Vasc Surg 2018;67:1404-9.)},

  abstract = {Purpose: This study was undertaken to define the long-term effects of renal revascularization on blood pressure, and renal and cardiac function in patients with Takayasu arteritis\textendash induced renal artery stenosis (TARAS). Methods: Twenty-seven patients (25 women; mean age, 27 years) with TARAS underwent intervention. Primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency rates were determined, and the late effects on blood pressure, renal and cardiac function, and survival were analyzed. Results: All patients had hypertension (mean blood pressure, 167/99 mm Hg; 2.5 antihypertensive medications per patient). Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients not receiving hemodialysis was 76 mL/min, and in five patients serum creatinine concentration was greater than 1.5 mg/dL. Three patients were hemodialysis-dependent, and two had intractable congestive heart failure. Forty interventions were performed, including 32 aortorenal bypass procedures, two repeat implantations, four nephrectomies, and two transluminal angioplasty procedures. Postoperative morbidity was 19\%. There were no deaths. During follow-up (mean, 68 months), three graft stenoses, all due to intimal hyperplasia, and three graft occlusions occurred. Two of three graft stenoses were successfully revised. At 1, 3, and 5 years of follow-up, primary patency was 87\%, 79\%, and 79\%, respectively; primary assisted patency was 93\%, 89\%, 89\%, respectively; and secondary patency was 93\%, 89\%, and 89\%, respectively. Intervention resulted in a decrease in blood pressure to a mean of 132/79 mm Hg (P {$<$} .0001), and the need for antihypertensive medications was reduced to one per patient (P {$<$} .01). Mean glomerular filtration rate increased to 88 mL/min (P {$<$} .005), and two patients no longer required hemodialysis. Congestive heart failure resolved in both patients, and did not recur. There were three deaths during follow-up, with 5-year and 10-year actuarial survival of 96\% and 80\%, respectively. Conclusions: Renal revascularization to treat TARAS is durable, has a salutary effect on blood pressure, and enhances long-term renal and cardiac function. This response establishes renal revascularization as a successful and durable intervention for TARAS, and a benchmark to which other therapies should be compared. (J Vasc Surg 2004;39:749-57.)},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the utility of gadolinium-enhancedthreedimensional (3D) time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the renal arteries in the evaluation of potential renal donors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients underwent gadolinium-enhanced3D-TOF MRA of the renal arteries as part of their evaluation as possible renal donors. All imaging was performed on a 1.5-T system with use of a torso phased-array coil. Conventional TI-weighted axial spin-echo and T2-weighted axial fast spin-echo imaging was performed to evaluate the renal parenchyma. Coronal dynamic MRA was performed during bolus injection of 40 mL of gadolinium with use of a 3D-TOF sequence requiring a breathhold of approximately 30 seconds. Maximum-intensityprojection reconstructions were obtained of the renal arterial and venous anatomy. All studies were prospectively evaluated by a single radiologist experienced with body MRA. Intraoperative findings were used as the reference standard in 35 patients. To evaluate interobserver variability, each examination was evaluated for image quality, renal artery number, and anatomy by two radiologists experienced with MRA and blinded to the other's interpretations and surgical results. RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of all MRAs were graded as diagnostic quality (Kappa value = 0.38; P {$<$} .05). Multiple renal arteries were identified in 29 (29\%)of 100 kidneys. Four of 50 patients studied (8\%)had renal parenchymal abnormalities identified with MR imaging. Sensitivity and specificity for accessory renal artery detection was 71\%and 95\%,respectively. Overall, accuracy for MRA in determining renal artery number was 90\%. CONCLUSION: Gadolinium-enhancedbreathhold 3D-TOF renal MRA is sufficient to assess the renal arteries in potential donors.},

  abstract = {Background: Percutaneous intervention for symptomatic renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) has replaced surgical therapy as first-line treatment. This study evaluates the factors that impact long-term anatomic and functional outcomes of endovascular therapy for symptomatic renal artery FMD. Methods: Records of patients who underwent renal artery angioplasty for FMD between January 1990 and December 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. Indication for intervention was poorly controlled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure {$>$}90 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure {$>$}140 mm Hg, or both, taking {$>$}2 antihypertensive medications). Twenty-nine women (average age, 45 years [range, 18-80]; 86\% with a history of hypertension {$<$}8 years) underwent 38 attempted interventions. Sixty-six percent of contralateral kidneys were normal (31\% had a {$<$}60\% stenosis), 13\% had {$>$}60\% stenosis, and the remainder were nonfunctioning or absent. Creatinine was {$>$}1.5 mg/dL in 4\%, 24\% had hyperlipidemia, 17\% had metabolic syndrome, and 4\% were considered diabetic. Outcomes: All interventions were successfully performed. Stent placement was required in 13\% for technical failure and flow-limiting dissection. Seventy-three percent of these lesions were in the proximal renal artery, with the remainder in the middle renal artery. Technical success ({$<$}30\% residual stenosis) was achieved in all vessels. There were no periprocedural or 90-day deaths. The procedurally related complication rate was 8\%. Median follow-up was 2 years. All patients were alive at follow-up. Primary and assisted primary patency rates were 66\% and 87\% at 5 years. Restenosis was considered a 50\% reduction in luminal area on angiography during follow-up. The restenosis rate was 28\% at 5 years (10 vessels underwent repeat percutaneous intervention). Immediate clinical benefit was seen in hypertension in 72\% (improved or cured {$<$}3 months) and was maintained in 73\% at 5 years by life-table analysis. Proportional hazard analysis showed the predictors of long-term clinical benefit were duration of hypertension {$<$}8 years, creatinine {$<$}1.5 mg/dL, ipsilateral kidney size {$>$}9 cm, functional status of the contralateral kidney, a fasting blood glucose {$<$}110 mg/dL, triglycerides {$<$}150 mg/dL, and high-density lipoprotein {$>$}50 mg/dL. Neither age {$<$}50 years nor statin administration appeared significant. Conclusions: Percutaneous endovascular intervention for clinically symptomatic FMD in the renal arteries is technically successful, safe, and durable. Most patients have immediate clinical benefit, with continued long-term results out to 5 years. It appears that the presence of existing renal pathology and markers of prediabetic state are associated with recurrence of hypertensive symptoms. ( J Vasc Surg 2008;48:865-71.)},

  abstract = {Purpose: To examine if the outcomes after endovascular treatment in hypertensive patients with renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and incidental atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) differ from the outcomes in patients with FMD alone. Materials and Methods: All cases of patients with renal artery FMD undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty during the period 2002\textendash 2012 were reviewed. The patients with complete data before and after the procedure were identified (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 84). Based on the procedural reports, these patients were separated into two cohorts: patients with isolated FMD (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 59) and patients with concomitant atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and FMD (ARAS-FMD) (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 25). The medical record of each patient was reviewed for baseline blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, and renal function data and the same data after the procedure. Procedural details including the angiographic findings, the number of stents placed, the average number of revascularization procedures, and the number of patients requiring more than one revascularization procedure were noted. Results: The study population included 68 patients (FMD, n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 46; ARAS-FMD, n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 22). Patients in the FMD and ARASFMD cohorts experienced comparable significant decreases in systolic and mean arterial pressures after endovascular intervention. There was no change in the number of antihypertensive medications after the procedure within or between groups. Patients in the ARAS-FMD cohort had lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rates (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .007); however, renal function stabilized in both groups after endovascular therapy. Conclusions: Patients with ARAS-FMD respond to endovascular therapy with outcomes similar to patients with isolated renal artery FMD.},

  abstract = {Background: Renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) are rare, with little known about their natural history and growth rate or their optimal management. The specific objectives of this study were to (1) define the clinical features of RAAs, including the precise growth rate and risk of rupture, (2) examine the current management and outcomes of RAA treatment using existing guidelines, and (3) examine the appropriateness of current criteria for repair of asymptomatic RAAs. Methods: A standardized, multi-institutional approach was used to evaluate patients with RAAs at institutions from all regions of the United States. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, aneurysm imaging, conservative and operative management, postoperative complications, and follow-up data were collected. Results: A total of 865 RAAs in 760 patients were identified at 16 institutions. Of these, 75\% were asymptomatic; symptomatic patients had difficult-to-control hypertension (10\%), flank pain (6\%), hematuria (4\%), and abdominal pain (2\%). The RAAs had a mean maximum diameter of 1.5 6 0.1 cm. Most were unilateral (96\%), on the right side (61\%), saccular (87\%), and calcified (56\%). Elective repair was performed in 213 patients with 241 RAAs, usually for symptoms or size {$>$}2 cm; the remaining 547 patients with 624 RAAs were observed. Major operative complications occurred in 10\%, including multisystem organ failure, myocardial infarction, and renal failure requiring dialysis. RAA repair for difficultto-control hypertension cured 32\% of patients and improved it in 26\%. Three patients had ruptured RAA; all were transferred from other hospitals and underwent emergency repair, with no deaths. Conservatively treated patients were monitored for a mean of 49 months, with no acute complications. Aneurysm growth rate was 0.086 cm/y, with no difference between calcified and noncalcified aneurysms. Conclusions: This large, contemporary, multi-institutional study demonstrated that asymptomatic RAAs rarely rupture (even when {$>$}2 cm), growth rate is 0.086 6 0.08 cm/y, and calcification does not protect against enlargement. RAA open repair is associated with significant minor morbidity, but rarely a major morbidity or mortality. Aneurysm repair cured or improved hypertension in {$>$}50\% of patients whose RAA was identified during the workup for difficult-to-control hypertension. (J Vasc Surg 2015;61:978-84.)},

  abstract = {Objective: Results of surgical revascularization in 25 patients with renal artery dissection (RAD) over 14 years, with mean follow-up of 55.3 months (range, 10-111 months), were analyzed. Indications for surgery were renovascular hypertension and preservation or improvement of kidney function. Patients and Methods: Two patients (both 20 years of age) underwent emergency surgery after severe trauma; 23 patients (mean age, 41 years) underwent elective surgery in a chronic stage of disease. Preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up examinations included duplex ultrasound scanning, determination of serum creatinine and urea concentrations, and evaluation of blood pressure control. All long-term patients underwent digital subtraction angiography preoperatively and postoperatively. All histologic specimens of resected renal arteries were re-evaluated by two independent pathologists. Results: Histologic re-evaluation confirmed the traumatic origin in 2 patients who underwent emergency surgery and 1 who underwent elective surgery. Renal artery dissection developed spontaneously, with no histologic signs of trauma or fibromuscular dysplasia, in 22 patients. In 17 revascularized kidneys (61\%) a kidney infarction had already developed preoperatively, and the kidneys were diminished in size or function. Results of revascularization and improvement of hypertension depended on preoperative extent of renal infarction. Hypertension resolved or improved in 86\% of patients without preoperative kidney damage, but in only 38\% with preoperatively damaged kidneys. Kidney function was preserved in 23 of 28 revascularized kidneys (82\%). During follow-up, late renal artery occlusion developed in 3 kidneys. Conclusions: Renal artery dissection can be effectively treated with surgical revascularization. Primary nephrectomy should be considered only in patients with a large ischemic kidney infarction, with significant deterioration of kidney function, to effectively cure or improve severe renovascular hypertension.

  abstract = {Abstract             Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is a well known but rarely diagnosed complication of percutaneous biopsy of kidney allografts. In the past diagnosis was usually made when clinical signs of an AVF occurred but Doppler ultrasonography has now enabled non-invasive diagnosis. Doppler examination of kidney allografts was performed after 100 biopsies. A total of ten AVFs were diagnosed within 2 weeks of biopsy. On repeated examination 2 months later, no additional fistula was detected. All fistulas were detected by abnormal colour shading of the artery and vein of the fistula caused by high blood velocity. Quantification in the artery supplying the fistula showed a higher systolic velocity compared with that in a normal artery of comparable size and location in the graft (mean (range) 64 (25\textendash 150) versus 36 (20\textendash 65) cm/s, P \&lt;0.05). Diastolic velocity was also higher in the artery supplying the fistula than in a normal artery (mean (range) 34 (9\textendash 72) versus 7 (0\textendash 13) cm/s, P \&lt;0.05). In the group with an AVF the proportion with a prolonged bleeding time (\&gt;3 min) was higher (80 versus 47 per cent, P \&lt; 0.05), as was the prevalence of a platelet count \&lt; 200 \texttimes{} 109/l (60 versus 22 per cent, P \&lt; 0.05). After detection of the fistula, four of the grafts were lost because of rejection and two patients died from sepsis during antirejection treatment. During follow-up of the remaining four AVFs three disappeared spontaneously and one persisted. None of the fistulas has had an impact on renal function requiring intervention. In conclusion, AVF is a complication observed frequently after kidney allograft biopsy that can be detected and monitored by Doppler ultrasonography.},

A variety of embolic materials are available, such as metal coils, sclerosants (glue, Onyx, absolute ethanol, lipiodol), and particulate embolic agents (polyvinyl alcohol particles and embospheres). Selection of the appropriate agent depends on the clinical application, technical and clinical endpoints, as well as the pathology lesion(s) targeted. Renal artery embolization can be performed alone or in combination with remodeling techniques, stent-grafting, and balloon- or stentassisted coiling in more complicated cases. The procedure is generally regarded as safe and effective for diverse applications and is considered as an evolving area in the field of endoluminal therapy.

  abstract = {Objective: Complete revascularization is recommended by many authors for treatment of intestinal ischemia. The observation that postprandial intestinal hyperemia is limited to the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) has suggested to us that SMA revascularization alone should be adequate treatment. We preferentially manage intestinal ischemia with a single bypass graft to the SMA and herein update our results using this approach. Methods: Patients were identified from a prospectively established vascular surgical registry. Each patient was assessed for acute versus chronic intestinal ischemia, preoperative angiographic findings, operation used, perioperative morbidity and mortality, late symptomatic relief, cause of death, and life table\textendash determined survival and graft patency. Graft patency was determined by follow-up angiography or duplex scanning. Results: Fifty bypass grafts to the SMA alone were performed in 49 patients (31 women, 18 men; mean age, 62 years) for treatment of intestinal ischemia. In all patients additional splanchnic arteries were available for bypass grafting. Operative indications were acute symptoms in 21 patients, 14 of whom had bowel infarction; chronic symptoms in 26 patients; and prophylaxis in conjunction with infrarenal aortic surgery in 3 patients. Thirty-two grafts originated from the aorta or an iliac artery, and 18 originated from an aortic graft. There were 40 prosthetic and 10 autogenous conduits. Perioperative mortality was 3\% in patients with chronic symptoms and 12\% overall. All survivors were symptomatically improved. Mean follow-up was 44 months. Nine-year assisted primary graft patency was 79\%, and 5-year patient survival was 61\%. Two late deaths occurred in patients with recurrent intestinal ischemia resulting from graft occlusions. Conclusions: Bypass grafting to the SMA alone appears to be both an effective and durable procedure for treatment of intestinal ischemia. Our results appear equal to those reported for ``complete'' revascularization for intestinal ischemia. When the SMA is a suitable recipient vessel, multiple bypass grafts to other splanchnic vessels are unnecessary in the treatment of intestinal ischemia. (J Vasc Surg 2000;32:37-47.)},

  abstract = {Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) remains a well-described disease process that is difficult to diagnose. Since its initial description more than a century ago, a myriad of diagnostic and treatment modalities have been applied to ameliorate the classic symptoms of postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss. It is estimated that mesenteric occlusive disease affects approximately 1\% to 18\% of the population, with a majority of these patients manifesting no symptoms of CMI. While associated with a small prevalence, the potential economic impact of this disease process, with the increasing age of the population and the catastrophic outcomes associated with no treatment, is significant. The primary etiology of CMI is atherosclerotic occlusive disease involving the ostia of the mesenteric arteries. Several studies have investigated the pathophysiology of the postprandial abdominal pain associated with ischemia focusing on transport mechanisms, claudication of the intestinal musculature, and ischemia of the visceral nerves. The process of diagnosing CMI involves assimilation of the presentation, typical history and physical examination findings, and results of imaging modalities. At the end of this diagnostic process, the decision to offer a patient surgical intervention is primarily based on symptomatology and results of duplex and other imaging modalities. There are specific criteria for which to offer symptomatic patients interventions. Patients who are asymptomatic do not need to undergo revascularization, which may disrupt collateral arterial circulation to the mesentery. They should be followed conservatively.},

Riolan was a strong defender of traditional Galenic doctrine in medicine and proved a vigorous opponent of the new concept of the circulation of blood as exposed by William Harvey (1578-1657). As confirmed by examining his anatomy book published in 1649, it is unlikely that Riolan would have conceived an arterial collateral pathway in the mesocolon. He probably had observed vascular arcades running along the inner border of the colon. It was not until 1743 that Albrecht von Haller (1708-1777) gave a detailed description of the anatomy of the mesenteric arteries, referring to the arterial collateral connection between the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries as the Arcus Riolani in honor of an old master of anatomy.},

The syndrome is caused by compression of the third part of the duodenum in the angle between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. This review updates etiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of the superior mesenteric artery syndrome. METHODS: Review of the literature. RESULTS: Frequently, predisposing medical conditions associated with catabolic states or rapid weight loss result in a decrease of the aortomesenteric angle and subsequent duodenal obstruction. External cast compression, anatomic variants and surgical alteration of the anatomy following spine surgery or ileoanal pouch anastomosis can also precipitate the syndrome. Once radiologic studies have established diagnosis, first-line treatment is usually conservative with jejunal or parenteral nutrition for restoration of the aortomesenteric fatty tissue. If conservative management fails, surgical options include open or laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy or duodenal mobilization and division of the ligament of Treitz. CONCLUSION: Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is clearly defined and frequently associated with a wide range of predisposing conditions and surgical procedures; clinicians have to consider this syndrome in such a setting. Larger studies are needed to better define the optimal treatment for this disease.},

Various medical and psychiatric conditions may result in the initial rapid weight loss which causes narrowing of the aortomesenteric angle. The vomiting and obstructive syndrome is then self-perpetuated regardless of the initiating factors. The young age and nonspecific symptoms often lead to a delay in diagnosis. DISCUSSION: A series of eight cases is presented reviewing the presentation, investigations, surgical treatment by division of duodenum and duodenojejunostomy, and outcomes. CONCLUSION: SMA syndrome is a well-described entity which must be considered as a cause of vomiting associated with significant weight loss in young adults. Surgical treatment should be allied with psychological assessment to treat any underlying psychosocial abnormality.},

Non-occlusive disease accounts for 20-30\% of all cases of acute mesenteric ischemia with a mortality rate of the order of 50\%. Acute abdominal pain may be the only early presenting symptom of mesenteric ischemia. Non-invasive imaging modalities, such as CT, MRI, and ultrasound, are able to evaluate the aorta and the origins of splanchnic arteries. Despite the technical evolution of those methods, selective angiography of mesenteric arteries is still the gold standard in diagnosing peripheral splanchnic vessel disease. In early non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia, as opposed to occlusive disease, there is no surgical therapy. It is known that mesenteric vasospasm persists even after correction of the precipitating event. Vasospasm frequently responds to direct intra-arterial vasodilator therapy, which is the only treatment that has been shown to be effective.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To provide a review of the etiology, clinical presentation, and imaging findings of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome. METHODS: A literature review of 24 relevant articles regarding SMA syndrome was performed. RESULTS: Clinicians and radiologists with a high index of suspicion based on symptomatology may pursue radiologic investigation in the form of upper gastrointestinal (GI) series and contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) are less commonly utilized modalities in the work-up of SMA syndrome, but provide imaging alternatives without the use of ionizing radiation. Imaging can assist in diagnosis by demonstrating characteristic findings of reduced aortomesenteric angle, reduced aortomesenteric distance, gastroduodenal distention, bowel caliber narrowing at the takeoff of the superior mesenteric artery from the aorta, as well as delayed gastric emptying or positional obstruction observed with real time with fluoroscopy. CONCLUSION: SMA syndrome is a rare disease that can go unrecognized and undiagnosed, exacerbating weight loss in an already significantly malnourished patient population. The diagnosis of SMA syndrome must be based on clinical symptomatology correlated with radiographic information. Once diagnosed, SMA syndrome can be safely treated by conservative measures although occasionally requires invasive intervention in the form of enteral tube placement, percutaneous jejunostomy tube placement, total parenteral nutrition, ligament of Treitz lysis, or duodenojejunostomy.},

We performed a blinded retrospective comparison of mesenteric duplex data with arteriography in 24 consecutive patients who underwent both studies. Arteriography revealed that eight superior mesenteric arteries were normal; five were minimally stenotic; eight had stenoses greater than or equal to 50\%, and three were occluded. Nine celiac arteries were normal or minimally stenotic; 12 had stenoses greater than or equal to 50\%, and three were occluded. Duplex scans were obtained after an overnight fast. In normal superior mesenteric arteries, peak systolic velocity (PSV) was 134 +/- 18 cm/sec and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) was 24 +/- 4 cm/sec. Superior mesenteric artery PSV in patients with minimal or no stenosis (171 +/- 22 cm/sec) was less than PSV in patients with severe (greater than 50\%) stenosis (299 +/- 40 cm/sec, p = 0.006), and less than PSV in patients with patent superior mesenteric arteries who underwent revascularization (366 +/- 86 cm/sec, p = 0.017). Similarly, EDV was elevated in superior mesenteric arteries with severe stenosis (78 +/- 11 cm/sec, p = 0.001) and in patients who underwent revascularization (111 +/- 19 cm/sec, p less than 0.001) compared to those with less than 50\% stenosis (30 +/- 6 cm/sec, p = 0.001). An EDV greater than 45 cm/sec was the best indicator of severe stenosis (sensitivity, 1.0; specificity, 0.92). Peak systolic velocity greater than 300 cm/sec was less sensitive (0.63), but highly specific (1.0) for severe superior mesenteric artery stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

METHODS: We reviewed the clinical data of 225 patients (65 male and 160 female; mean age, 72 {$\pm$} 12 years) treated for CMI at two academic centers (2000-2010). Outcomes were analyzed in patients who had primary intervention or reintervention using BMS (n = 164 patients/197 vessels) or CS (n = 61 patients/67 vessels). End points were freedom from restenosis, symptom recurrence, reinterventions, and patency rates. RESULTS: Patients in both groups had similar demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and extent of disease. In the primary intervention group (mean follow-up, 29 {$\pm$} 12 months), patients treated by CS had higher freedom from restenosis (92\% {$\pm$} 6\% vs 53\% {$\pm$} 4\%; P = .003), symptom recurrence (92 {$\pm$} 4\% vs 50 {$\pm$} 5\%; P = .003), reintervention (91\% {$\pm$} 6\% vs 56\% {$\pm$} 5\%; P = .005), and better primary patency at 3 years (92\% {$\pm$} 6\% vs 52\% {$\pm$} 5\%; P {$<$} .003) than for BMS.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although rare, superior mesenteric artery (SMA) aneurysms have a definite rupture risk. Past reports have suggested that this risk is low, yet most investigators recommend repair in selected patients. We reviewed our experience with 21 patients to try to determine when intervention was indicated. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records of all patients with SMA aneurysms at our institutions from January 1980 through December 1998 was undertaken. Only patients with true aneurysms of the SMA were included. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with true SMA aneurysms were identified and included 14 males (67\%) and seven females (33\%). This represents a 6.9\% incidence rate of all visceral aneurysms seen at our institutions. Eight patients (38\%) had rupture at presentation, including seven of the 14 males (50\%). In contrast to previous reports, only one patient (4.7\%) had an infectious etiology. Five patients were on beta-blocker therapy, but none were seen with rupture. However, eight of the remaining 16 patients (50\%) without beta-blockade had rupture. Thirteen patients (62\%) had calcified aneurysms, but all ruptures were seen in noncalcified aneurysms. Operative intervention occurred in 11 of the 21 patients (52\%). All eight patients with rupture underwent operation, including six ligations and one successful embolization, and one patient died before completion of repair. The operative mortality rate was 37.5\% for ruptured aneurysms. Elective repair included one prosthetic graft, one excision and patch angioplasty, and one embolization, with no mortality. Ten of the 21 patients (48\%) with SMA aneurysms were observed, and all were alive and well at a mean of 67 months' follow-up (range, 2 to 148 months). CONCLUSION: SMA aneurysms are rare but appear to have a higher risk of rupture than previously reported. Male patients and patients with noncalcified aneurysms appear to have a greater risk of rupture. beta-Blockade may have some protective effect against aneurysm rupture. Intervention is reasonable in all patients at good operative risk with SMA aneurysms, considering the high rupture rate in our series.},

  abstract = {Infected aneurysms are uncommon. The aorta, peripheral arteries, cerebral arteries, and visceral arteries are involved in descending order of frequency. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species are the most common causative pathogens. Early clinical diagnosis of infected aneurysms is challenging owing to their protean manifestations. Clinically apparent infected aneurysms are often at an advanced stage of development or are associated with complications, such as rupture. Nontreatment or delayed treatment of infected aneurysms often has a poor outcome, with high morbidity and mortality from fulminant sepsis or hemorrhage. Current state-of-the-art imaging modalities, such as multidetector computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, have replaced conventional angiography as minimally invasive techniques for detection of infected aneurysms in clinically suspected cases, as well as characterization of infected aneurysms and vascular mapping for treatment planning in confirmed cases. Doppler ultrasonography allows noninvasive assessment for infected aneurysms in the peripheral arteries. Imaging features of infected aneurysms include a lobulated vascular mass, an indistinct irregular arterial wall, perianeurysmal edema, and a perianeurysmal soft-tissue mass. Perianeurysmal gas, aneurysmal thrombosis, aneurysmal wall calcification, and disrupted arterial calcification at the site of the infected aneurysm are uncommon findings. Imaging-guided endovascular stent-graft repair and embolotherapy can be performed in select cases instead of open surgery. Familiarity with the imaging appearances of infected aneurysms should alert the radiologist to the diagnosis and permit timely treatment, which may include endovascular techniques.},

METHODS: Fifteen patients (11 women; mean age, 56 y; range, 39-80 y) with splenic artery aneurysm (n = 13) or false aneurysm (n = 2) were treated with coil embolization. The lesion was asymptomatic in 9 patients, symptomatic in 5 patients, and ruptured in 1 patient. The mean aneurysm diameter was 33 +/- 23 mm (range, 15-80 mm). Postoperative follow-up evaluation included a clinical visit and spiral computed tomography at 1, 4, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. RESULTS: Endovascular treatment was possible in 14 patients (93\%) (1 failure: neck cannulation). Perioperative mortality was not observed. Morbidity included postembolization syndrome in 5 patients (30\%). Neither pancreatitis nor spleen abscess occurred. The mean follow-up period was 36 months (range, 3-60 mo). During follow-up evaluation we detected 1 sac reperfusion that was sealed successfully with additional coils. Surgical conversion or open repair were never required. CONCLUSIONS: At our institute, endovascular treatment represents the first-line treatment for splenic artery aneurysms. Postembolization syndrome and infarcts are common events but generally resolve without sequelae.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aims to reveal the experience with endovascular and surgical management of intact splenic artery aneurysms in our single center. METHOD: Between January 2011 and June 2017, 42 patients with intact splenic artery aneurysm were enrolled in this study. Twenty patients undergoing surgical intervention were classified as the surgical group, and 22 patients who received endovascular repair were categorized as the endovascular group. Demographic data, preoperative comorbidities, and anatomical characteristics of aneurysms were collected and analyzed. Details of interventions, perioperative outcomes, and follow-up results were evaluated and compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Forty-two patients with a mean age of 53.4~{$\pm~$}11.6~years were enrolled in this study, and 44 aneurysms were repaired. Thirty-nine (92.9\%) patients were asymptomatic, and 3 (7.1\%) patients were symptomatic. The diameter of splenic artery aneurysms was 3.3~{$\pm~$}1.6~cm, and the shape was mostly saccular. In the surgical group, the common methods used were splenic artery aneurysm resection (9 patients), followed by splenic artery aneurysms resection and splenectomy (6 patients), splenic artery aneurysm resection and arterial reconstruction with end-to-end anastomosis (3 patients), and laparoscopic splenic artery aneurysm resection coexisting with splenectomy (2 patients). In the endovascular group, the exclusive means was embolization with coils. The technical success rates in both open repair and endovascular repair were 100\%. The 30-day mortality was nil, and no severe complication was found in the early time except that 1 patient suffered multiple splenic abscess in the endovascular group after embolization. Endovascular repair had significantly shorter surgery time (82.5~{$\pm~$}27.6 vs 191.9~{$\pm~$}62.7~min, P~{$<~$}0.001) and hospital stay (5.6~{$\pm~$}3.1 vs 10.8~{$\pm~$}5.2~days, P~{$<~$}0.001) compared with open repair. The median follow-up period in this study was 34.5 (interquartile range 16.8-60.8) months. Two sac reperfusions were detected during the follow-up in the endovascular group, and patients needed new embolization. No late deaths were found in the follow-up period, and the freedom from reintervention in the endovascular group at 1 and 3~years postoperatively was 95.5\% and 82.4\%, respectively. In addition, the freedom from reintervention in the surgical group at both 1 year and 3~years postoperatively were 100\%. No significant differences were observed in late survival and reintervention between open repair and endovascular repair. CONCLUSIONS: Open repair and endovascular repair were equally feasible, safe, and effective for intact splenic artery aneurysm. Endovascular repair is less invasive accompanied with an obvious decrease in surgery time and rapid recovery with a short hospital time.},

  abstract = {After the invention of the balloon catheter by Fogarty in 1963, surgical thromboembolectomy was considered the gold standard treatment for many years in patients with acute lower limb ischemia (ALLI). ALLI is a dramatic event, carrying a high risk of amputation and perioperative morbidity and mortality. The evolution of endovascular technologies has resulted in a variety of therapeutic options to establish arterial patency. In the 1970s, Dotter first introduced the idea of clot lysis in the treatment of ALLI, which was modified to catheter-directed thrombolysis, and now clot aspiration techniques. Currently, the majority of ALLI (about 70\%) is arterial thrombosis, which generally occurs in the setting of preexisting vascular lesion. This condition is very common in patients with diabetes. Clinical presentation in case of thrombosis on atherosclerotic stenosis (so called "acute on chronic ischemia") may be less severe, but treatment is generally more challenging than ALLI due to embolism, considering the complexity in device trackability through the diseased vessels, potential vessel injury, incomplete revascularization, and need of correction of underlying vascular lesions. Although surgery is still a treatment option, especially for ALLI, endovascular interventions have assumed a prominent role in restoring limb perfusion. In this review, the treatment options for ALLI are detailed from surgical thromboembolectomy to thrombolysis and current endovascular techniques, including mechanical fragmentation, rheolytic thrombectomy, and aspiration thrombectomy. The evolution to endovascular therapies has resulted in improved clinical outcomes and lower rates of morbidity.},

  abstract = {Objectives Acute aortic occlusion (AAO) is a life-threatening event necessitating prompt revascularization to the pelvis and lower extremities. Due to its uncommon nature, outcomes after revascularization for AAO are not well-characterized. Our aim was to describe the perioperative morbidity and mortality associated with revascularization and to identify the patients at highest risk. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed of patients who presented to our institution from 2006\textendash 2017 with acute distal aortic occlusion. Patients with a prior aortofemoral bypass were excluded, but those with aortoiliac stents were included. Baseline demographics and comorbidities, preoperative clinical presentation and imaging, procedural details, and postoperative hospital course were reviewed. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, and major complications were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Logistic regression models were constructed to identify factors associated with 30-day mortality. Results We identified 65 patients who underwent revascularization for AAO. Median age was 63 (range 35\textendash 89) and 64.6\% were male. 56.4\% of patients presented within 24 hours of symptom onset, and 43.8\% were treated within 6 hours of presentation. There were particularly high rates of prior coronary artery disease (62.3\%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (41.0\%). 18.5\% had prior iliac stents. Preoperative imaging in 44 patients showed occlusion of the inferior mesenteric artery in 36.0\% and both internal iliac arteries (IIAs) in 34.7\%. Treatments for revascularization included axillobifemoral bypass (55.4\%), aortoiliac thromboembolectomy (15.4\%), aortobifemoral bypass (13.9\%), and aortoiliac stenting (15.4\%). Overall 30-day mortality was 27.7\% and was not affected by treatment modality. Mortality was highest in patients over age 60 (40.5\% vs. 10.7\%, P = .01) and those presenting with lactate elevation (45.5\% vs. 5.9\%, P = .004) or motor deficit in at least one extremity (36.6\% vs. 9.5\%, P = .03). Univariate predictors of 30-day mortality were age {$\geq$}60 (OR 5.68, 95\% CI 1.45\textendash 22.26, P = .01); presentation with motor deficit (OR 5.48, 95\% CI 1.12\textendash 26.86, P = .04); presentation with elevated lactate level (OR 13.33, 95\% CI 1.58\textendash 11.57, P = .02); history of prior stroke (OR 4.80, 95\% CI 1.21\textendash 18.97, P = .03); or bilateral internal iliac artery occlusion (OR 7.11, 95\% CI 1.54\textendash 32.91, P = .01). At least one postoperative complication was observed in 78.5\% of patients, including: acute kidney injury (56.9\%, with 21.5\% requiring hemodialysis); respiratory complications (46.2\%); cardiovascular complications (33.9\%); major amputation (15.4\%, bilateral in 7.7\%); and bowel ischemia (10.8\%). Conclusions Even with prompt revascularization, and despite the chosen treatment modality, acute aortic occlusion carries high risk of mortality and numerous life-threatening complications. Older patients presenting with elevated lactate levels, motor deficit, and bilateral internal iliac artery occlusions are at the highest risk of perioperative mortality. These factors may aid in risk stratification and managing expectations in this critically ill population.},

  abstract = {Objective: Acute lower extremity ischemia secondary to arterial thromboembolism is a common problem. Contemporary data regarding this problem are sparse. This report examines a 10-year single-center experience and describes the surgical management and outcomes observed. Methods: Procedural codes were used to identify consecutive patients treated surgically for acute lower extremity embolization from January 2002 to September 2012. Patients presenting {$>$}7 days after onset of symptoms, occlusion of grafts/ stents, and cases secondary to trauma or iatrogenic injury were excluded. Data collected included demographics, medical comorbidities, presenting clinical characteristics, procedural specifics, and postoperative outcomes. Results were evaluated using descriptive statistics, product-limit survival analysis, and logistic regression multivariable modeling. Results: The study sample included 170 patients (47\% female). Mean age was 69.1 6 16.0 years. Of these, 82 patients (49\%) had a previous history of atrial fibrillation, and four (2\%) were therapeutically anticoagulated (international normalized ratio \$2.0) at presentation. Presentation for 83\% was {$>$}6 hours after symptom onset, and 9\% presented with a concurrent acute stroke. Femoral artery exploration with embolectomy was the most common procedural management and was used for aortic, iliac, and infrainguinal occlusion. Ten patients (6\%) required bypass for limb salvage during the initial operation. Local instillation of thrombolytic agents as an adjunct to embolectomy was used in 16\%, fasciotomies were performed in 39\%, and unexpected return to the operating room occurred in 24\%. Ninety-day amputation above or below the knee was required during the index hospitalization in 26 patients (15\%). In-hospital or 30-day mortality was 18\%. Median (interquartile range) length of stay was 8 days (4, 16 days), and 36\% of patients were discharged to a nursing facility. Recurrent extremity embolization occurred in 23 patients (14\%) at a median interval of 1.6 months. The 5-year amputation freedom and survival estimates were 80\% and 41\%, respectively. Predictors of 90-day amputation included prior vascular surgery, gangrene, and fasciotomy. Predictors of 30-day mortality included age, history of coronary artery disease, prior vascular surgery, and concurrent stroke. Conclusions: Despite advances in contemporary medical care, lower extremity arterial embolization remains a condition that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, the condition is resource-intensive to treat and is likely preventable (initially or in recurrence) in a substantial subset of patients. (J Vasc Surg 2014;60:702-7.)},

  abstract = {Background Recent controlled trials suggest that thrombolytic therapy may be an effective initial treatment for acute arterial occlusion of the legs. A major potential benefit of initial thrombolytic therapy is that limb ischemia can be managed with less invasive interventions. Methods In this randomized, multicenter trial conducted at 113 North American and European sites, we compared vascular surgery (e.g., thrombectomy or bypass surgery) with thrombolysis by catheter-directed intraarterial recombinant urokinase; all patients (272 per group) had had acute arterial obstruction of the legs for 14 days or less. Infusions were limited to a period of 48 hours (mean [ϮSE], 24.4Ϯ0.86), after which lesions were corrected by surgery or angioplasty if needed. The primary end point was the amputation-free survival rate at six months. Results Final angiograms, which were available for 246 patients treated with urokinase, revealed recanalization in 196 (79.7 percent) and complete dissolution of thrombus in 167 (67.9 percent). Both treatment groups had similar significant improvements in mean ankle\textendash brachial blood-pressure index. Amputation-free survival rates in the urokinase group were 71.8 percent at six months and 65.0 percent at one year, as compared with respective rates of 74.8 percent and 69.9 percent in the surgery group; the 95 percent confidence intervals for the differences were Ϫ10.5 to 4.5 percentage points at six months (Pϭ0.43) and Ϫ12.9 to 3.1 percentage points at one year (P ϭ 0.23). At six months the surgery group had undergone 551 open operative procedures (excluding amputations), as compared with 315 in the thrombolysis group. Major hemorrhage occurred in 32 patients in the urokinase group (12.5 percent) as compared with 14 patients in the surgery group (5.5 percent) (P ϭ 0.005). There were four episodes of intracranial hemorrhage in the urokinase group (1.6 percent), one of which was fatal. By contrast, there were no episodes of intracranial hemorrhage in the surgery group. Conclusions Despite its association with a higher frequency of hemorrhagic complications, intraarterial infusion of urokinase reduced the need for open surgical procedures, with no significantly increased risk of amputation or death.

Aortic plaques may give rise to two types of emboli: thromboemboli and atheroemboli (cholesterol crystal emboli). Thromboemboli are relatively large, tend to occlude medium to large arteries, and cause strokes, transient ischemic attacks, and renal infarcts and other forms of peripheral thromboembolism. Cholesterol crystal emboli are relatively minute, tend to occlude small arteries and arterioles, and may cause the blue toe syndrome, new or worsening renal insufficiency, gut ischemia, etc. Transesophageal echocardiography remains the gold standard for visualization of aortic plaques in the thoracic aorta.

  abstract = {Cholesterol emboli syndrome is a relatively rare, but potentially devastating, manifestation of atherosclerotic disease. Cholesterol emboli syndrome is characterized by waves of arterio-arterial embolization of cholesterol crystals and atheroma debris from atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta or its large branches to small or medium caliber arteries (100-200~{$\mu$}m in diameter) that frequently occur after invasive arterial procedures. End-organ damage is due to mechanical occlusion and inflammatory response in the destination arteries. Clinical manifestations may include renal failure, blue toe syndrome, global neurologic deficits and a variety of gastrointestinal, ocular and constitutional signs and symptoms. There is no specific therapy for cholesterol emboli syndrome. Supportive measures include modifications of risk factors, use of statins and antiplatelet agents, avoidance of anticoagulation and thrombolytic agents, and utilization of surgical and endovascular techniques to exclude sources of cholesterol emboli.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Primary aortic mural thrombus (AMT) is a rare entity. Asymptomatic AMT may be found in imaging studies for other disease studies. Symptomatic AMT as embolic events may localize in the arterial branches of the aorta; limb ischemia is the most usual clinical presentation, though. However, when proximal aorta is compromised, visceral branches occlusion and ischemia may determine morbidity and mortality in these patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study with collection of data from January 2011 to September 2016. Medical records of patients were reviewed for: demographic data, cardiovascular risk factors or any known prothrombotic predisposing condition, clinical presentation, vessel of embolism, localization of aortic thrombus, treatment of AMT and symptoms, follow-up, and computed tomography scan imaging findings. RESULTS: A total of 8 patients were included in the study. Mean age was 54.7~{$\pm~$}11.5~years, with male/female ratio 3:1. Four (50\%) patients had AMT at the arch or descending aorta, 3 (37.5\%) patients in the infrarenal sector, and the remaining in the visceral aorta. All but one patient received anticoagulation alone for the aortic thrombus. Patient with femoral thromboembolectomy died in the early postoperative time due to severe massive embolism. Median follow-up was 23~months (range, 1-50). Five out of seven patients showed complete aortic thrombus resolution in imaging follow up. None of the patients presented recurrence of embolic events. CONCLUSIONS: An anticoagulation first-approach treatment may be reasonable if mild organ damage is encountered. This strategy may be continued if no recurrences in embolic events are encountered, as high percentage of thrombus resolution is expected. Open or endovascular may be saved for life-threatening visceral or arch branches damage.},

  abstract = {Objective Aortic sources of peripheral and visceral embolization remain challenging to treat. The safety of stent graft coverage continues to be debated. This study reports the outcomes of stent coverage of these complex lesions. Methods Hospital records were retrospectively reviewed for patients undergoing aortic stenting between 2006 and 2013 for visceral and peripheral embolic disease. Renal function, method of coverage, and mortality after stent grafting were reviewed. Results Twenty-five cases of embolizing aortic lesions treated with an endovascular approach were identified. The mean age was 65 {$\pm$} 13 years (range, 45\textendash 87 years), and 64\% were female. Sixteen (64\%) patients presented with peripheral embolic events, six with concomitant renal embolization. Five patients presented with abdominal or flank pain, and two were discovered incidentally. Three patients had undergone an endovascular procedure for other indications within the preceding 6 months of presentation. Nineteen patients had existing chronic kidney disease (stage II or higher), but only three had stage IV disease. Of the eight patients tested, four had a diagnosed hypercoagulable state. Eight of the patients had lesions identified in multiple aortic segments, and aortic aneurysm disease was present in 24\%. Coverage of both abdominal and thoracic sources occurred in eight patients, whereas 17 had only one segment covered. Minimal intraluminal catheter and wire manipulation was paired with the use of intravascular ultrasound in an effort to reduce embolization and contrast use. Intravascular ultrasound was used in the majority of cases and transesophageal echo in 28\% of patients. Two patients with stage IV kidney disease became dialysis-dependent within 3 months of the procedure. No other patients had an increase in their postoperative or predischarge serum creatinine levels. No embolic events were precipitated during the procedure, nor were there any recurrent embolic events detected on follow-up. The 1-year mortality rate was 25\%. Conclusions Endovascular coverage of atheroembolic sources in the aorta is feasible and is safe and effective in properly selected patients. It does not appear to worsen renal function when performed with the use of specific technical strategies.},

  abstract = {Objective: Primary aortic mural thrombus (PAMT) is an uncommon condition but an important source of noncardiogenic emboli with a difficult diagnosis and a high rate of complications, including high mortality. We report our experience of thromboembolic disease from PAMT and review its contemporary management. Methods: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of all patients who presented with acute occlusion of a limb or visceral vessels between January 2011 and September 2013 was performed. Results: A total of 88 patients presented with acute occlusion of the extremities or visceral arteries. All underwent extensive evaluation for the possible source of the embolism. Of these 88 patients, 19 patients (mean age, 41.2 years; male:female ratio, 1:2.1) were found to have aortic mural thrombus as the source of distal embolism. Thrombus was located in the thoracic aorta in 10 patients, in the perivisceral aorta in three patients, and in the infrarenal aorta in six patients. Thrombus in the thoracic aorta was treated with stent grafts in four patients, bare metal stents in three patients, and anticoagulation alone in two patients. In the suprarenal abdominal aorta, all three patients underwent trapdoor aortic thrombectomy. Infrarenal aortic thrombus was managed by aortobifemoral embolectomy in two patients, aortic stenting in two patients, surgical thrombectomy in one patient, and anticoagulation alone in one patient. Successful treatment, defined as freedom from further embolic events or recurrence of thrombus, was achieved in 14 of 19 patients (76.4\%) with a mean follow-up period of 16.2 months (range, 2-28 months). There were four (21\%) thrombus-related deaths, all due to primary thromboembolic insults. One patient needed a below-knee amputation because of a recurrent thrombotic episode. Conclusions: Symptomatic PAMT is an uncommon but important source of noncardiogenic embolus. It appears to occur more frequently in young women. Endovascular coverage of the aortic thrombus, when feasible, appears to be an effective and safe procedure with either stent grafts or closed-cell metal stents. When thrombus is located adjacent to visceral vessels, it should be managed with an open trapdoor thromboembolectomy. (J Vasc Surg 2014;60:1524-34.)},

  abstract = {Background Intermittent claudication can be neurogenic or vascular. Physicians use a profile based on symptom attributes to differentiate the 2 types of claudication, and this guides their investigations for diagnosis of the underlying pathology. We evaluated the validity of these symptom attributes in differentiating neurogenic from vascular claudication. Methods Patients with a diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) or peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who reported claudication answered 14 questions characterizing their symptoms. We determined the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR and NLR) for neurogenic and vascular claudication for each symptom attribute. Results We studied 53 patients. The most sensitive symptom attribute to rule out LSS was the absence of ``triggering of pain with standing alone'' (sensitivity 0.97, NLR 0.050). Pain alleviators and symptom location data showed a weak clinical significance for LSS and PVD. Constellation of symptoms yielded the strongest associations: patients with a positive shopping cart sign whose symptoms were located above the knees, triggered with standing alone and relieved with sitting had a strong likelihood of neurogenic claudication (PLR 13). Patients with symptoms in the calf that were relieved with standing alone had a strong likelihood of vascular claudication (PLR 20.0). Conclusion The classic symptom attributes used to differentiate neurogenic from vascular claudication are at best weakly valid independently. However, certain constellation of symptoms are much more indicative of etiology. These results can guide general practitioners in their evaluation of and investigation for claudication.},

  abstract = {Objective: A meta-regression analysis was conducted to identify the most reliable treadmill protocol for the assessment of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Background: Treadmill testing is the main assessment method to evaluate walking ability in patients with PAD in clinical studies. Reported treadmill protocols are continuous (C) and graded (G) protocols and outcome measurements are initial claudication distance (ICD) and absolute claudication distance (ACD). Variety in protocols might hamper the ability to compare results of different studies. Ideally, future studies should use a protocol with highest reliability. Methods: We searched PubMed and EMBASE (until February 2008) and we hand searched the reference lists. Trials assessing reliability of treadmill testing were identified. Inclusion criteria were the use of a C- or G-protocol, repetition of this protocol, and a retrievable intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). We identified eight studies in which 658 patients were included. Results: For ICD, the estimated reliabilities of the C- and G-protocol (as assessed by the ICC) were 0.85 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.82-0.88) and 0.83 (95\% CI: 0.80-0.85), respectively, without dependency of the reliability on velocity or grade. For ACD, the reliability was significantly better for the G-protocol (0.95, 95\% CI: 0.94-0.96) than for the C-protocol. Moreover, the reliability of the C-protocol was dependent on grade of the treadmill (0\%, 10\%, and 12\%) with a mean ICC of 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.54-0.88), 0.89 (95\% CI: 0.86-0.91), and 0.91 (95\% CI 0.88-0.92), respectively. Conclusion: Treadmill assessment has the highest reliability when using a G-protocol together with the ACD as the primary outcome measure. ( J Vasc Surg 2009;50:322-9.)},

The predictors of a change in the ABI with exercise have received little attention. Design Cross-sectional analysis. Materials Two hundred sixty-five participants of the San Diego Population Study with a resting ABI between 0.90 and 1.10 performed 50 heel raises and immediately had their ABIs measured again. Methods We examined the relationship between the change in the ABI with exercise and multiple potential risk prediction variables using linear regression. In addition, the categorical percent change in the ABI with exercise was analyzed by multinomial logistic regression. Results The mean age of the participants was 71.8 years old, and 80.4\% were female. At rest, the average ABI was 1.04 (SD 0.04) before and 0.94 (SD 0.13) after exercise; a mean decrease of 9.5\%. In analyses of ABI change as a continuous variable, higher age, any smoking history, and a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were associated with a significant decrease in the ABI with exercise (p = 0.01, 0.04, and 0.03 respectively). Categorical analyses of the risk factors associated with a 20\% or greater ABI decrease with exercise confirmed these results. Congestive heart failure was associated with an increased ABI with exercise (p = 0.04) in continuous ABI change analyses only. Conclusions Older age, a positive history of smoking, and a history of COPD were independently and significantly associated with a greater ABI decrease with exercise. These risk variables may help identify persons with subclinical PAD.},
