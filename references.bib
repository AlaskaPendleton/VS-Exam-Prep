  abstract = {Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers in estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their decision making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a Web-based survey and revised during a 3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document. To aid the editorial process and readers of prediction model studies, it is recommended that authors include a completed checklist in their submission (also available at www.tripod-statement.org).

  abstract = {Background: The appropriateness of percutaneous intervention for moderate to severe carotid in-stent restenosis (C-ISR) is unclear. We therefore sought to compare stroke/death/myocardial infarction (MI) rates between percutaneous interventions and nonoperative management for \$50\% C-ISR. Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective review of consecutive patients presenting with \$50\% C-ISR to the vascular surgery service. Demographics, comorbidities, and intraoperative and postoperative variables were obtained. The degree of stenosis was verified by review of digital subtraction or computed tomography angiograms. The primary outcome was stroke/death/MI after the diagnosis of \$50\% C-ISR. c2, Kruskal-Wallis, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to quantify outcomes of the patients treated percutaneously vs nonoperatively. Results: During a 13-year period, 59 patients (75 C-ISRs) presented with \$50\% C-ISRs (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 58 male [98\%]; n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 57 C-ISRs asymptomatic [76\%]) with a median age of 67.5 years (62.8-74.6). The initial pathologic process underlying the original stent was atherosclerosis in 33 (70\%), radiation induced in 10 (21\%), prior carotid endarterectomy in 4 (9\%), and unknown in 28 (37\%). Forty C-ISRs underwent a percutaneous intervention (19 percutaneous angioplasty only [48\%]; 21 repeated stent and percutaneous angioplasty [52\%]). Median follow-up for the entire cohort was 948 days (283-2322) and similar between the intervention and nonintervention arms. There were no significant differences between the arms with respect to age (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .16), medical comorbidities (P {$>$} .05), original stent type (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .46), or clopidogrel use (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .74). At 30 days, there was one stroke and subsequent death in the intervention arm and none in the nonintervention arm. During the follow-up period, a median of 1.0 procedure was required to maintain patency. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, there were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and nonintervention arms with respect to stroke/death/MI as a composite or any of the individual components at last follow-up (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .82). Kaplan-Meier estimated patency was not significantly superior in the intervention vs the nonintervention arm (8.0 years 6 1.1 vs 5.3 years 6 0.7; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .14). Conclusions: Over 13 years, percutaneous interventions for \$50\% C-ISR were safe and durable. However, interventions fail to improve long-term stroke/death/MI or patency rates relative to nonintervention. Intervention for C-ISR may not be necessary, although future appropriately powered, prospective trials will be necessary to confirm these findings and to determine the appropriateness of interventions for C-ISR.

  abstract = {Background               A successful open surgical operation to remove atheromatous carotid artery narrowing that has not yet caused a stroke (asymptomatic carotid stenosis) carries some procedural risk but, if completed successfully, halves patients' future annual stroke risk for at least 10 years. A newer, less invasive alternative is carotid stenting, which also carries some procedural risk, especially if the carotid lesion has recently given rise to a stroke (symptomatic carotid stenosis). For both surgery and stenting, improvements in technique (and in medication) have reduced risk. Early studies showed that treating carotid narrowing by stenting, particularly for symptomatic lesions, caused more procedural minor strokes than surgery, but more recent trials in symptomatic and in asymptomatic patients found that both procedures might now be equally safe and effective. However, low patient numbers, short follow-up of the long-term effects on stroke rates and wide confidence intervals mean that worldwide uncertainty persists between carotid surgery and carotid stenting, and national and international guidelines remain unclear as to which is generally better.                                         Objectives               The second Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST-2) compares carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with carotid artery stenting (CAS) directly, randomising patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis for whom a carotid procedure is considered definitely necessary; both procedures seem anatomically feasible, and there is substantial uncertainty as to which of the two would be better for such individuals. Although it will compare procedural risks, the trial's primary aim is to compare the long-term durability of protection against strokes occurring in the years post procedure due to any remaining or recurrent carotid disease.

  abstract = {Background If carotid artery narrowing remains asymptomatic (ie, has caused no recent stroke or other neurological symptoms), successful carotid endarterectomy (CEA) reduces stroke incidence for some years. We assessed the long-term effects of successful CEA. Methods Between 1993 and 2003, 3120 asymptomatic patients from 126 centres in 30 countries were allocated equally, by blinded minimised randomisation, to immediate CEA (median delay 1 month, IQR 0{$\cdot$}3\textendash 2{$\cdot$}5) or to indefinite deferral of any carotid procedure, and were followed up until death or for a median among survivors of 9 years (IQR 6\textendash 11). The primary outcomes were perioperative mortality and morbidity (death or stroke within 30 days) and non-perioperative stroke. Kaplan-Meier percentages and logrank p values are from intention-to-treat analyses. This study is registered, number ISRCTN26156392. Findings 1560 patients were allocated immediate CEA versus 1560 allocated deferral of any carotid procedure. The proportions operated on while still asymptomatic were 89{$\cdot$}7\% versus 4{$\cdot$}8\% at 1 year (and 92{$\cdot$}1\% vs 16{$\cdot$}5\% at 5 years). Perioperative risk of stroke or death within 30 days was 3{$\cdot$}0\% (95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}4\textendash 3{$\cdot$}9; 26 non-disabling strokes plus 34 disabling or fatal perioperative events in 1979 CEAs). Excluding perioperative events and non-stroke mortality, stroke risks (immediate vs deferred CEA) were 4{$\cdot$}1\% versus 10{$\cdot$}0\% at 5 years (gain 5{$\cdot$}9\%, 95\% CI 4{$\cdot$}0\textendash 7{$\cdot$}8) and 10{$\cdot$}8\% versus 16{$\cdot$}9\% at 10 years (gain 6{$\cdot$}1\%, 2{$\cdot$}7\textendash 9{$\cdot$}4); ratio of stroke incidence rates 0{$\cdot$}54, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}43\textendash 0{$\cdot$}68, p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001. 62 versus 104 had a disabling or fatal stroke, and 37 versus 84 others had a non-disabling stroke. Combining perioperative events and strokes, net risks were 6{$\cdot$}9\% versus 10{$\cdot$}9\% at 5 years (gain 4{$\cdot$}1\%, 2{$\cdot$}0\textendash 6{$\cdot$}2) and 13{$\cdot$}4\% versus 17{$\cdot$}9\% at 10 years (gain 4{$\cdot$}6\%, 1{$\cdot$}2\textendash 7{$\cdot$}9). Medication was similar in both groups; throughout the study, most were on antithrombotic and antihypertensive therapy. Net benefits were significant both for those on lipid-lowering therapy and for those not, and both for men and for women up to 75 years of age at entry (although not for older patients). Interpretation Successful CEA for asymptomatic patients younger than 75 years of age reduces 10-year stroke risks. Half this reduction is in disabling or fatal strokes. Net benefit in future patients will depend on their risks from unoperated carotid lesions (which will be reduced by medication), on future surgical risks (which might differ from those in trials), and on whether life expectancy exceeds 10 years.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Previous clinical trials have suggested that carotid-artery stenting with a device to capture and remove emboli (``embolic protection'') is an effective alternative to carotid endarterectomy in patients at average or high risk for surgical complications. METHODS In this trial, we compared carotid-artery stenting with embolic protection and carotid endarterectomy in patients 79 years of age or younger who had severe carotid stenosis and were asymptomatic (i.e., had not had a stroke, transient ischemic attack, or amaurosis fugax in the 180 days before enrollment) and were not considered to be at high risk for surgical complications. The trial was designed to enroll 1658 patients but was halted early, after 1453 patients underwent randomization, because of slow enrollment. Patients were followed for up to 5 years. The primary composite end point of death, stroke, or myocardial infarction within 30 days after the procedure or ipsilateral stroke within 1 year was tested at a noninferiority margin of 3 percentage points. RESULTS Stenting was noninferior to endarterectomy with regard to the primary composite end point (event rate, 3.8\% and 3.4\%, respectively; P\,=\,0.01 for noninferiority). The rate of stroke or death within 30 days was 2.9\% in the stenting group and 1.7\% in the endarterectomy group (P\,=\,0.33). From 30 days to 5 years after the procedure, the rate of freedom from ipsilateral stroke was 97.8\% in the stenting group and 97.3\% in the endarterectomy group (P\,=\,0.51), and the overall survival rates were 87.1\% and 89.4\%, respectively (P\,=\,0.21). The cumulative 5-year rate of stroke-free survival was 93.1\% in the stenting group and 94.7\% in the endarterectomy group (P\,=\,0.44).

The proper treatment of patients with carotid bifurcation disease is of major interest to vascular surgeons and other vascular specialists. In 2011, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for the treatment of carotid artery disease. At the time, several randomized trials, comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS), were reported. Since the 2011 guidelines, several studies and a few systematic reviews comparing CEA and CAS have been reported, and the role of medical management has been reemphasized. In the present publication, we have updated and expanded on the 2011 guidelines with specific emphasis on five areas: (1) is CEA recommended over maximal medical therapy for low-risk patients; (2) is CEA recommended over transfemoral CAS for low surgical risk patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis of {$>$}50\%; (3) the timing of carotid intervention for patients presenting with acute stroke; (4) screening for carotid artery stenosis in asymptomatic patients; and (5) the optimal sequence of intervention for patients with combined carotid and coronary artery disease.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite level I evidence supporting a role for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the management of patients with asymptomatic carotid disease, there is surprisingly little international consensus regarding the optimal way to manage these patients. Methods: Review of current strategies for managing asymptomatic carotid disease Main findings: Those favouring a pro-interventional approach argue that: (i) until new randomised trials demonstrate that best medical therapy (BMT) is better than CEA or carotid artery stenting (CAS) in preventing stroke, guidelines of practice should remain unchanged; (ii) strokes secondary to carotid thromboembolism harboured a potentially treatable asymptomatic lesion prior to the event. Because 80\% of strokes are not preceded by a TIA/minor stroke, CEA/CAS is the only way of preventing these strokes; (iii) screening for carotid disease could identify patients with significant asymptomatic stenoses who could undergo prophylactic CEA/CAS in order to prevent avoidable stroke; (iv) international guidelines already advise that only `highly-selected' patients should undergo CEA/CAS; (v) the 30-day risks of death/stroke after CEA/CAS are diminishing and this will increase longterm stroke prevention and (vi) the alleged decline in annualized stroke rates in medically treated patients is based upon flawed data. Conclusions: The inescapable conclusion is that only a relatively small proportion of asymptomatic patients benefit from prophylactic CEA/CAS. The key question, therefore, remains; is society prepared to invest sufficient resources in identifying these `high risk for stroke' patients so that they can benefit from aggressive BMT and CEA or CAS, leaving the majority of lower risk patients to be treated medically? \textcopyright{} 2014 Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (Scottish charity number SC005317) and Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.

  abstract = {Background Statins reduce the incidence of strokes among patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease; whether they reduce the risk of stroke after a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) remains to be established. Methods We randomly assigned 4731 patients who had had a stroke or TIA within one to six months before study entry, had low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of 100 to 190 mg per deciliter (2.6 to 4.9 mmol per liter), and had no known coronary heart disease to double-blind treatment with 80 mg of atorvastatin per day or placebo. The primary end point was a first nonfatal or fatal stroke. Results The mean LDL cholesterol level during the trial was 73 mg per deciliter (1.9 mmol per liter) among patients receiving atorvastatin and 129 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter) among patients receiving placebo. During a median follow-up of 4.9 years, 265 patients (11.2 percent) receiving atorvastatin and 311 patients (13.1 percent) receiving placebo had a fatal or nonfatal stroke (5-year absolute reduction in risk, 2.2 percent; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to 0.99; P\,=\,0.03; unadjusted P\,=\,0.05). The atorvastatin group had 218 ischemic strokes and 55 hemorrhagic strokes, whereas the placebo group had 274 ischemic strokes and 33 hemorrhagic strokes. The five-year absolute reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events was 3.5 percent (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.92; P\,=\,0.002). The overall mortality rate was similar, with 216 deaths in the atorvastatin group and 211 deaths in the placebo group (P\,=\,0.98), as were the rates of serious adverse events. Elevated liver enzyme values were more common in patients taking atorvastatin.

Design: systematic review of 97 published studies following 8972 staged or synchronous operations. Results: mortality was highest in patients undergoing synchronous CEA Â‡ CABG (4.6\%, 95\% CI 4.1{$\pm$}5.2). Reverse staged procedures (CABG \`A CEA) were associated with the highest risk of ipsilateral stroke (5.8\%, 95\% CI 0.0{$\pm$}14.3) and any stroke (6.3\%, 95\% CI 1.0{$\pm$}11.7). Peri-operative myocardial infarction (MI) was lowest following the reverse staged procedure (0.9\%, 95\% CI 0.5{$\pm$}1.4) and highest in patients undergoing staged CEA \`A CABG (6.5\%, 95\% CI 3.2{$\pm$}9.7). The risk of death + any stroke was highest in patients undergoing synchronous CEA Â‡ CABG (8.7\%, 95\% CI 7.7{$\pm$}9.8) and lowest following staged CEA \`A CABG (6.1\%, 95\% CI 2.9{$\pm$}9.3). The risk of death/stroke or MI was 11.5\% (95\% CI 10.1{$\pm$}12.9) following synchronous procedures versus 10.2\% (95\% CI 7.4{$\pm$}13.1) after staged CEA then CABG. Conclusions: 10{$\pm$}12\% of patients undergoing staged or synchronous procedures suffered death or major cardiovascular morbidity (stroke, MI) within 30 days of surgery. Overall, there was no significant difference in outcomes for staged and synchronous procedures and no comparable data for patients with combined cardiac and carotid disease not undergoing staged or synchronous surgery.},

  abstract = {Objective: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases morbidity and mortality after vascular procedures and adversely affects late survival of patients. The presence of CKD also confers increased risk of stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Patients undergoing carotid intervention in the Vascular Study Group of New England database were stratified by CKD status referable to periprocedural and late outcomes. Methods: All carotid artery stenting and carotid endarterectomies (CEAs) performed from 2003 to 2013 were stratified by CKD severity as mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] {$>$}60 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR 30-59), and severe (eGFR {$<$}30). The impact of CKD on outcomes of carotid procedures was evaluated using univariate and multivariate methods. Results: Of 12,568 patients identified, 11,746 (93\%) underwent CEA and 822 (7\%) underwent carotid artery stenting. Procedures were performed for symptomatic disease in 40\%. CKD severity was mild in 58\%, moderate in 35\%, and severe in 7\%. The 30-day stroke rate was very low across all CKD groups (1.76\% mild vs 1.84\% moderate and 1.34\% severe; P [ .009). The 30-day mortality increased with worsening renal function (0.4\% mild vs 0.9\% moderate and 0.9\% severe; P [ .01). Independent predictors of 30-day stroke or death included American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 4 or 5 (odds ratio, 2.3; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-3.4; P [ .0001). Multivariable Cox hazards regression showed that severe CKD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.8; 95\% CI, 1.3-2.6), ASA class 4 or 5 (HR, 1.7; 95\% CI, 1.3-2.2), preoperative cortical symptoms (HR, 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.2-1.8), history of diabetes (HR, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.7), and age (HR, 1.03/y; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.04) independently (all P {$<$} .01) predicted neurologic events or death at median follow-up of 12.7 months (interquartile range, 10.3-15.2 months). CKD did not increase the risk of neurologic events at 1-year follow-up. Predictors (P {$<$} .05) of late death included moderate CKD (HR, 1.3; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.7), severe CKD (HR, 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.6-2.9), ASA class 4 or 5 (HR, 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.2-2.0), history of diabetes (HR, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.2-1.7), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.8), and cortical symptoms (HR, 1.3; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.6). The 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates decreased with worsening renal function (log-rank test, P {$<$} .001), but patients with severe CKD maintained a 71\% survival at 5 years. Conclusions: CKD severity increases risk of perioperative mortality as well as late mortality. Patients with CKD benefit from stroke-free survival especially after CEA. Unlike patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease, for whom severe CKD reduces median survival to w2.5 years, patients with CKD and carotid disease exhibit much longer survival. This suggests that carotid interventions have utility in carefully selected patients with moderate and severe CKD, particularly in symptomatic disease. (J Vasc Surg 2016;64:1295-302.)},

  abstract = {Objective: The incidence of carotid artery stenosis after head and neck radiation is anticipated to rise due to the increasing survival of patients with head and neck malignancies. It remains unclear whether carotid artery stenting (CAS) or endarterectomy (CEA) is the best treatment strategy for radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis. Materials \& Methods: This study was performed according to the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Eligible studies were identified through a comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Central until July 20, 2017. A meta-analysis of random effects model was conducted. The I-square statistic was used to assess for heterogeneity. Results: Five studies and 143 patients were included. Periprocedural stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) and death rates were similar between the two revascularization approaches. However, the risk for cranial nerve (CN) injury was higher in the CEA group (OR: 7.09; 95\% CI: 1.17 \textendash{} 42.88; I2 =0\%). CEA was associated with lower mortality rates after a mean follow-up of 50 months (OR: 0.29; 95\% CI: 0.09 \textendash{} 0.97; I2 =0\%). No difference was identified in long-term restenosis rates between CEA and CAS. Conclusions: Patients with radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis can safely undergo both CAS and CEA with similar risks of periprocedural stroke, MI and death. However, patients treated with CEA have a higher risk for periprocedural CN injuries and a lower risk for long-term mortality.},

The most frequent cause of the hemodynamic changes leading to VBI is atherosclerosis. The main clinical symptoms are dizziness, vertigo, headaches, vomit, diplopia, blindness, ataxia, imbalance, and weakness in both sides of the body. Even though arteriography is considered the most important exam to diagnose the disease, the inherent risks of this exam should be taken into consideration. The magnetic resonance angiography has been widely studied and is a good method to identify and localize any occlusions and stenosis in both neck and intracranial great vessels. ,  Conclusion {$\quad$}Each patient with a suspected diagnosis of VBI should be individually evaluated and treated, taking in consideration the pros and cons of each diagnostic testing and treatment option.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial, we found no significant difference between the stenting group and the endarterectomy group with respect to the primary composite end point of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death during the periprocedural period or any subsequent ipsilateral stroke during 4 years of follow-up. We now extend the results to 10 years. METHODS Among patients with carotid-artery stenosis who had been randomly assigned to stenting or endarterectomy, we evaluated outcomes every 6 months for up to 10 years at 117 centers. In addition to assessing the primary composite end point, we assessed the primary end point for the long-term extension study, which was ipsilateral stroke after the periprocedural period. RESULTS Among 2502 patients, there was no significant difference in the rate of the primary composite end point between the stenting group (11.8\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 9.1 to 14.8) and the endarterectomy group (9.9\%; 95\% CI, 7.9 to 12.2) over 10 years of follow-up (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95\% CI, 0.83 to 1.44). With respect to the primary long-term end point, postprocedural ipsilateral stroke over the 10-year follow-up occurred in 6.9\% (95\% CI, 4.4 to 9.7) of the patients in the stenting group and in 5.6\% (95\% CI, 3.7 to 7.6) of those in the endarterectomy group; the rates did not differ significantly between the groups (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95\% CI, 0.64 to 1.52). No significant between-group differences with respect to either end point were detected when symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients were analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS Over 10 years of follow-up, we did not find a significant difference between patients who underwent stenting and those who underwent endarterectomy with respect to the risk of periprocedural stroke, myocardial infarction, or death and subsequent ipsilateral stroke. The rate of postprocedural ipsilateral stroke also did not differ between groups.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for symptomatic stenosis of the internal carotid artery benefit from early intervention. Heterogeneous data are available on the influence of timing of carotid artery stenting (CAS) on procedural risk. Methods\textemdash We investigated the association between timing of treatment (0\textendash 7 days and {$>$}7 days after the qualifying neurological event) and the 30-day risk of stroke or death after CAS or CEA in a pooled analysis of individual patient data from 4 randomized trials by the Carotid Stenosis Trialists' Collaboration. Analyses were done per protocol. To obtain combined estimates, logistic mixed models were applied. Results\textemdash Among a total of 4138 patients, a minority received their allocated treatment within 7 days after symptom onset (14\% CAS versus 11\% CEA). Among patients treated within 1 week of symptoms, those treated by CAS had a higher risk of stroke or death compared with those treated with CEA: 8.3\% versus 1.3\%, risk ratio, 6.7; 95\% confidence interval, 2.1 to 21.9 (adjusted for age at treatment, sex, and type of qualifying event). For interventions after 1 week, CAS was also more hazardous than CEA: 7.1\% versus 3.6\%, adjusted risk ratio, 2.0; 95\% confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.7 (P value for interaction with time interval 0.06). Conclusions\textemdash In randomized trials comparing stenting with CEA for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, CAS was associated with a substantially higher periprocedural risk during the first 7 days after the onset of symptoms. Early surgery is safer than stenting for preventing future stroke.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traumatic internal carotid artery dissection (CAD) has a potentially grave outcome. Anticoagulant therapy may be ineffective or contraindicated; surgery impractical. We present our experience with endovascular stenting in CAD patients. METHODS: From 2004 to 2011, 23 patients with angiographically proven traumatic CAD underwent endovascular stent-assisted arterial reconstruction based on clinical and radiographic criteria: contraindication or failure of anticoagulation, evidence of impending ischemic stroke, or need for urgent intracranial revascularization. Dissections were graded based on degree of stenosis and extent of injury. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (73.9\%) presented with stroke or transient ischemic attack. Carotid revascularization was achieved with one (11 patients, 48\%) or multiple stents (12 patients, 52\%); distal protection was used rarely (three patients, 13\%). No complications were directly attributed to stenting. Mean dissection-related stenosis improved from 72\% Ï® 28.87\% to 4\% Ï® 8.29\%. At a mean clinical follow-up of 28.7 months Ï® 31.9 months, 16 patients (69.6\%) improved, six (26.1\%) remained stable, and one (4.3\%) had died secondary to multiple traumatic injuries. At long-term follow-up, no patient had a transient ischemic attack or stroke or presented evidence of de novo in-stent stenosis or stent thrombosis. There were no neurologic sequelae after partial or total discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy in seven patients undergoing trauma-related surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: Selected cases of traumatic CAD can be safely managed by endovascular stent-assisted angioplasty. Procedural complications are infrequent; the need for postprocedure antiplatelet therapy is a concern. Early detection is essential to avoid stroke. Stenting restores the integrity of the vessel lumen immediately, efficiently prevents the occurrence or recurrence of ischemic events, and avoids the need of long-term anticoagulation.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carotid and vertebral artery dissections are a leading cause of stroke in young individuals. OBJECTIVE: To examine the published safety and efficacy of endovascular stenting for extracranial artery dissection. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify all cases of endovascular management of extracranial carotid and vertebral artery dissections. RESULTS: For carotid dissections, our review yielded 31 published reports including 140 patients (153 vessels). Reported etiologies were traumatic (48\%, n = 64), spontaneous (37\%, n = 49), and iatrogenic (16\%, n = 21). The technical success rate of stenting was 99\%, and the procedural complication rate was 1.3\%. Mean angiographic follow-up was 12.8 months (range, 2-72 months) and revealed in-stent stenosis or occlusion in 2\% of patients. Mean clinical follow-up was 17.7 months (range, 1-72 months), and neurological events were seen in 1.4\% of patients. For vertebral artery dissections, our review revealed 8 reports including 10 patients (12 vessels). Etiologies were traumatic (60\%, n = 6), spontaneous (20\%, n = 2), and iatrogenic (20\%, n = 2). There was a 100\% technical success rate. The mean angiographic follow-up period was 7.5 months (range, 2-12 months). No new neurological events were reported during a mean clinical follow-up period of 26.4 months (range, 3-55 months). CONCLUSION: Endovascular management of extracranial arterial dissection continues to evolve. Current experience shows that this treatment option is safe and technically feasible. Prospective randomized trials compared with medical management are needed to further elucidate the role of stenting.},

  abstract = {Background: Subclavian artery revascularization is frequently performed in the setting of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). However, there is little information on the short- and long-term outcomes of patients undergoing carotid to subclavian artery bypass in this clinical setting. As such, this study sought to define the early and late outcomes associated with this procedure. Methods: Patients undergoing carotid-subclavian bypass in conjunction with TEVAR between June 2005 and September 2016 were retrospectively identified from a prospectively maintained, single-center aortic surgery database. The 30-day outcomes specific to the carotid-subclavian bypass procedure were analyzed, including cervical plexus nerve injury, bleeding complications, and local vascular complications. All preoperative and postoperative chest radiographs were carefully analyzed to assess for hemidiaphragm elevation indicative of phrenic nerve palsy. Long-term outcomes included primary graft patency and anastomotic complications. Results: Of 579 consecutive patients undergoing TEVAR during this time interval, 112 patients (19\%) underwent concomitant carotid-subclavian bypass. The cohort was 38\% female (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 43), with a mean age of 65 6 14 years. The majority of conduits were 8-mm polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 107 [95.5\%]), with a minority being reversed saphenous vein (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 4 [3.6\%]) or Dacron (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1 [0.9\%]) grafts. The bypass procedure was done concurrently at the time of TEVAR in 91\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 102) of cases. The short-term complication rate attributed specifically to the carotid-subclavian bypass was 29\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 33). These complications included phrenic nerve palsy in 25\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 27), recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy in 5\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 6), axillary nerve palsy in 2\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2), and neck hematoma requiring re-exploration in 1\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1) of patients. The 30-day in-hospital all-cause mortality rate was 5\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 6), and the rate of permanent paraparesis or paraplegia was 0.9\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1). Of the operative survivors (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 106), follow-up imaging of the bypass graft was available in 87\% (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 92) of patients. Actuarial primary graft patency was 97\% at 5 years. There were three patients (3\%) with bypass graft occlusions, two of which were clinically silent and detected on follow-up imaging. The third was detected because of symptoms of subclavian steal and required repeated revascularization. Two patients (2\%) developed a late anastomotic pseudoaneurysm requiring either endovascular (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1) or surgical (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1) intervention. Conclusions: Carotid-subclavian bypass for revascularization of the subclavian artery performed in the setting of TEVAR is durable, although the true complication rate is likely higher than is generally reported in the literature because of a not insignificant rate of phrenic nerve palsy. These data should serve well as ``gold standard'' comparison data for emerging branch graft devices. (J Vasc Surg 2019;69:701-9.)},

  abstract = {Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) consists of a group of distinct pathologies arising as a result of compression of structures at the thoracic outlet. The structures at risk are, from anterior to posterior, the subclavian vein, subclavian artery and brachial plexus. Compression or impingement causes venous (VTOS), arterial (ATOS) or neurogenic (NTOS) TOS. NTOS is the most common presentation, caused by compression of the brachial plexus at the scalene triangle or pectoralis minor space. Other compression syndromes at the carpal and cubital tunnels should be excluded. Management is usually conservative, employing physiotherapy and postural exercises, but pain or muscle wasting may be indications for surgery. VTOS is caused by compression of the subclavian vein at the costoclavicular junction, resulting in venous thrombosis, the Paget-Schroetter syndrome, often as a result of exercise in fit young muscular people or musicians. Positional swelling of the upper limb without thrombosis is termed McCleery's syndrome. In the presence of thrombosis, clot lysis, first rib excision and venoplasty may be indicated. ATOS occurs due to compression of the subclavian artery at the scalene triangle, often in association with an anomalous bony structure, such as cervical rib, causing post-stenotic aneurysmal dilation of the artery, thrombosis and embolization. Acute upper limb ischaemia necessitates urgent cervical rib excision and arterial reconstruction.},

METHODS: We generate strong (Grade 1) and weak (Grade 2) recommendations based on high- (Grade A), moderate- (Grade B), and low- (Grade C) quality evidence. RESULTS: For VTE and no cancer, as long-term anticoagulant therapy, we suggest dabigatran (Grade 2B), rivaroxaban (Grade 2B), apixaban (Grade 2B), or edoxaban (Grade 2B) over vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy, and suggest VKA therapy over low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; Grade 2C). For VTE and cancer, we suggest LMWH over VKA (Grade 2B), dabigatran (Grade 2C), rivaroxaban (Grade 2C), apixaban (Grade 2C), or edoxaban (Grade 2C). We have not changed recommendations for who should stop anticoagulation at 3 months or receive extended therapy. For VTE treated with anticoagulants, we recommend against an inferior vena cava filter (Grade 1B). For DVT, we suggest not using compression stockings routinely to prevent PTS (Grade 2B). For subsegmental pulmonary embolism and no proximal DVT, we suggest clinical surveillance over anticoagulation with a low risk of recurrent VTE (Grade 2C), and anticoagulation over clinical surveillance with a high risk (Grade 2C). We suggest thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism with hypotension (Grade 2B), and systemic therapy over catheter-directed thrombolysis (Grade 2C). For recurrent VTE on a non-LMWH anticoagulant, we suggest LMWH (Grade 2C); for recurrent VTE on LMWH, we suggest increasing the LMWH dose (Grade 2C). CONCLUSIONS: Of 54 recommendations included in the 30 statements, 20 were strong and none was based on high-quality evidence, highlighting the need for further research. CHEST 2016; 149(2):315-352},

  abstract = {Background: Most clinicians feel that treatment for patients with acute primary axillosubclavian vein thrombosis (``effort thrombosis'') is catheter-directed thrombolysis followed by thoracic outlet decompression. Several investigators feel that first rib resection (FRR) is not indicated in every case. No randomized data exist to answer this question. Methods: A MEDLINE search was done using the terms ``Paget-Schroetter syndrome,'' ``upper extremity DVT,'' ``first rib resection,'' ``effort thrombosis,'' and ``primary upper extremity thrombosis,'' with thrombolysis used as an ``AND'' term. We also specifically explored references cited to support either side of this argument in the past. Analysis was limited to patients aged 18 years or older with symptoms of 14-day duration or less undergoing thrombolysis for primary axillosubclavian vein thrombosis. Those studies that did not report follow-up, duplicate series from the same institution, and those in which patients were stented were excluded. Results were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis, with groups assigned according to each authors' prospectively described algorithm. Results: Twelve series were included. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to treatment after thrombolysis: FRR (448 patients), FRR plus endovenous balloon venoplasty (FRR + PLASTY; 68 patients), and those with no further intervention after thrombolysis (rib not removed; 168 patients). Symptom relief at last follow-up was significantly more likely in the FRR (95\%) and FRR + PLASTY (93\%) groups than in the rib not removed (54\%) group (both {$<$}0.0001) as was patency (98\%, 86\%, and 48\%, respectively; both {$<$}0.0001 vs. rib not removed). More than 40\% of patients in the rib not removed group eventually required rib resection for recurrent symptoms. No differences in symptom-free rates were seen when comparing FRR with FRR + PLASTY. Conclusions: In patients with acute effort thrombosis who undergo thrombolysis, permanent symptom relief and long-term patency are more likely to be achieved in patients who undergo FRR with or without endovenous balloon venoplasty than those whose rib is left intact.},

  abstract = {Safe and expeditious exposure of the upper extremity vascular system requires a thorough knowledge of the relevant anatomy. Exposure proximally is more difficult than in the periphery, for two reasons: First, the bony thorax restricts and slows exposure, most relevant in traumatic situations. Second, there are several nerves intimately involved with the vessels proximally which should be preserved for best outcomes. This chapter describes exposures from the aortic arch to the wrist, and provides helpful details for safe and efficient surgery.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for symptomatic stenosis of the internal carotid artery benefit from early intervention. Heterogeneous data are available on the influence of timing of carotid artery stenting (CAS) on procedural risk. Methods\textemdash We investigated the association between timing of treatment (0\textendash 7 days and {$>$}7 days after the qualifying neurological event) and the 30-day risk of stroke or death after CAS or CEA in a pooled analysis of individual patient data from 4 randomized trials by the Carotid Stenosis Trialists' Collaboration. Analyses were done per protocol. To obtain combined estimates, logistic mixed models were applied. Results\textemdash Among a total of 4138 patients, a minority received their allocated treatment within 7 days after symptom onset (14\% CAS versus 11\% CEA). Among patients treated within 1 week of symptoms, those treated by CAS had a higher risk of stroke or death compared with those treated with CEA: 8.3\% versus 1.3\%, risk ratio, 6.7; 95\% confidence interval, 2.1 to 21.9 (adjusted for age at treatment, sex, and type of qualifying event). For interventions after 1 week, CAS was also more hazardous than CEA: 7.1\% versus 3.6\%, adjusted risk ratio, 2.0; 95\% confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.7 (P value for interaction with time interval 0.06). Conclusions\textemdash In randomized trials comparing stenting with CEA for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, CAS was associated with a substantially higher periprocedural risk during the first 7 days after the onset of symptoms. Early surgery is safer than stenting for preventing future stroke.},
